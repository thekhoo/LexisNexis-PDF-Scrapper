The provisions of the CJA \\n2003, Part II, ch. 2, while retaining the concept of the hearsay rule as a rule of exclusion, are designed to ensure \\nthat, subject to the necessary safeguards, relevant hearsay evidence should be admitted where it is in the interests \\nof justice. The provisions of the CJA 2003 constitute a 'crafted code' which, properly applied, is consistent with the \\nright to fair trial accorded by the ECHR, Article 6(3)(d) (Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373: see F17.89). \\nThe rulings of the Grand Chamber in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v UK (2012) 54 EHRR 23 (807) and Horncastle v UK \\n(2015) 60 EHRR 31 (1331) (see F17.89) accept, contrary to previous Strasbourg case law, that the CJA 2003 \\ncontains sufficient safeguards against the risk of wrongful conviction. It is convenient to begin with an overview of \\nthe Act's provisions before embarking on the detail.\\nThe CJA 2003 applies to trials and other hearings to which the strict rules of evidence apply, and also to \\nproceedings under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, s. 4A, the purpose of which is to mirror the fact-\\nfinding process at a criminal trial (Chal [2007] EWCA Crim 2647, [2008] 1 Cr App R 18 (247)).\\nOverview of Criminal Justice Act 2003: Hearsay Exceptions and Additional Safeguards\\nF17.2\\nFour Exceptions The four headings under which hearsay evidence may be admitted are set out in the CJA 2003, \\ns. 114. They are (1) statutory exceptions (including but not limited to, the exceptions provided in the CJA 2003 \\nitself); (2) common-law exceptions (but only as preserved by s. 118); (3) agreement of all parties; and (4) cases \\nwhere it is in the 'interests of justice' to admit hearsay. This section of this work deals with the more important of the \\nvarious exceptions to the hearsay rule which operate in criminal cases, with the exception of confessions, which are \\ndealt with at F18, and the previous consistent and inconsistent statements of witnesses, dealt with at F6.32 and \\nF7.51 respectively. Although the CJA 2003 has significantly simplified the law in this area, it remains the case that \\nthe various exceptions overlap: for example, the first-hand hearsay statement of a deceased victim of violence \\nadmissible under the CJA 2003, s. 116, might, if made under the influence of the event itself, also be received \\nunder the common-law res gestae exception preserved by s. 118(1).\\nF17.3\\nCriminal Justice Act 2003, s. 114\\n(1)     In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence \\nof any matter stated if, but only if—\\n (a)     any provision of this chapter or any other statutory provision makes it admissible,\\n (b)     any rule of law preserved by section 118 makes it admissible,\\n (c)     all parties to the proceedings agree to it being admissible, or\\nOverview of Criminal Justice Act 2003: Hearsay Exceptions and Additional Safeguards\\n (d)     the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be admissible.\\nSee F16.1 for the proceedings to which s. 114 applies and for elaboration of the definition of hearsay ('a statement \\nnot made in oral evidence … etc.').\\nF17.4\\nThe Four Exceptions and Additional Safeguards for Hearsay Evidence It is important to note that bringing \\nhearsay under one of the four headings for admissibility is only the first step in a longer process required to ensure \\nthat the fairness of the trial is not adversely affected. In Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373, the Supreme \\nCourt emphasised the importance of the other safeguards to be applied, only some of which appear on the face of \\nthe CJA 2003. Within the Act, there are three related provisions. They are s. 124, which provides for the testing of \\ncredibility where the maker of a hearsay statement does not attend to testify (see F17.87); s. 125, which deals with \\nthe power to stop a case where evidence is unconvincing (see F17.98); and s. 126, which provides a specific \\ndiscretion to exclude hearsay evidence (see F17.94). In addition, all prosecution evidence is subject to the court's \\ngeneral powers of discretionary exclusion, of which the PACE 1984, s. 78, is the most important (F17.88). The \\njudge is also obliged to direct the jury, where hearsay evidence is received, as to the dangers of acting upon it (see \\nF17.96).\\nAlthough the steps towards admitting hearsay evidence are explained separately in the text which follows, the \\ndecisions to be made at trial are typically arrived at in an integrated way. In Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 \\nAll ER 349, Hughes LJ explained that the main concern of the court, particularly in the more controversial cases of \\nhearsay covered by s. 116(2) (death, illness, absence abroad, the lost witness, and fear) or by the interests of \\njustice exception in s. 114(1)(d), is the risk of unreliability, and the extent to which the reliability of the evidence can \\nsafely be tested and assessed. The statutory framework can therefore usefully be considered in these successive \\nsteps.\\n (a)     Is there a specific statutory justification (or 'gateway') permitting the admission of hearsay evidence (ss. \\n116 to 118)?\\n (b)     What material is there which can help to test or assess the hearsay (s. 124)?\\n (c)     Is there a specific 'interests of justice' test at the admissibility stage?\\n (d)     If there is no other justification or gateway, should the evidence nevertheless be considered for \\nadmission on the grounds that admission is, despite the difficulties, in the interests of justice (s. 114(1)(d))?\\n (e)     Even if prima facie admissible, ought the evidence to be ruled inadmissible (PACE 1984, s. 78, and/or \\nCJA 2003, s. 126)?\\n (f)     If the evidence is admitted, should the case subsequently be stopped under s. 125?\\nWhere a judge permits hearsay evidence to be adduced, the detail behind the ruling should be given before \\nspeeches, so that counsel may tailor their speeches to the ruling and, where appropriate, make submissions in \\nrespect of the content of the proposed hearsay direction in light of the ruling (Kiziltan [2017] EWCA Crim 1461, \\n[2018] 4 WLR 43). In Daley [2017] EWCA Crim 1971 it was said that the direction should be given before the \\nevidence is heard, and repeated in the summing-up.\\n\"]\n",

      "['\\nCriminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses', \"  >  PART F EVIDENCE  >  Section F17 Exceptions to the Rule \\nagainst Hearsay (Excluding Confessions)  >  HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS: (1) HEARSAY ADMISSIBLE \\nBY AGREEMENT, UNAVAILABLE WITNESSES AND BUSINESS DOCUMENTS\\nF17.7\\nA literal reading of the CJA 2003, s. 116, suggests that hearsay falling within its provisions is (with the exception of \\nwitnesses in fear) automatically admissible, and this was the original intention. However, the fair trial rights of \\ndefendants have required a different stance following the decision of the Supreme Court in Horncastle [2009] UKSC \\n14, [2010] 2 AC 373, as hearsay cannot be 'nodded through or adduced as a matter of routine' (per Gross LJ in \\nFriel [2012] EWCA Crim 2871), but must be carefully handled with due regard to its significance in the case and the \\npossible weaknesses of hearsay evidence. The overall scheme to ensure that hearsay is relied upon only to the \\nextent that it is safe to do so is described at F17.3. In most cases the mechanism for ensuring that unsatisfactory \\nhearsay tendered by the prosecution is excluded is the PACE 1984, s. 78, the use of which is specifically \\npreserved, in relation to ss. 116 and 117, by s. 126(2). In relation to hearsay tendered by the defence, the PACE \\n1984, s. 78, does not apply, leading to concerns that the CJA 2003 would facilitate the manufacture of hearsay \\nevidence (cf. Bailey [2008] EWCA Crim 817). However, there is a further discretion to exclude contained in the CJA \\n2003, s. 126(1)(b), which applies equally to prosecution and defence evidence. Although capable of being narrowly \\nconstrued as applicable only to 'superfluous' hearsay, s. 126(1)(b) may have a wider application, specifically in \\nrelation to hearsay that lacks probative value (see F17.95).\\nThe starting point for any assessment of admissibility is that 'the necessity for resort to second-hand evidence must \\nbe demonstrated' (per Hughes LJ in Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349) and that this has \\nimplications not only for the question whether it is fair to admit a statement which satisfies one of the conditions laid \\ndown in s. 116(2), but also for the need for rigorous assessment of whether the condition is itself made out, in \\nparticular in relation to absent witnesses who may be fearful or who have absented themselves (see F17.14 and \\nF17.17). To the extent that some early authorities under the CJA 2003 may have been based on a more informal \\nassessment of the satisfaction of one of the conditions, they have been overtaken by the approach required by \\nHorncastle and subsequent decisions of the Court of Appeal including Riat.\\nF17.8\\nCriminal Justice Act 2003, ss. 116 and 123\\n116. —\\n(1) In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of \\nany matter stated if—\\n (a)     oral evidence given in the proceedings by the person who made the statement would be admissible as \\nevidence of that matter,\\n (b)     the person who made the statement (the relevant person) is identified to the court's satisfaction, and\\n (c)     any of the five conditions mentioned in subsection (2) is satisfied.\\n(2)     The conditions are—\\n (a)     that the relevant person is dead;\\n (b)     that the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition;\\nCriminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\n (c)     that the relevant person is outside the United Kingdom and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his \\nattendance;\\n (d)     that the relevant person cannot be found although such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to \\nfind him have been taken;\\n (e)     that through fear the relevant person does not give (or does not continue to give) oral evidence in the \\nproceedings, either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement, and the court gives \\nleave for the statement to be given in evidence.\\n(3)     For the purposes of subsection (2)(e) 'fear' is to be widely construed and (for example) includes fear of the \\ndeath or injury of another person or of financial loss.\\n(4)     Leave may be given under subsection (2)(e) only if the court considers that the statement ought to be \\nadmitted in the interests of justice, having regard—\\n (a)     to the statement's contents,\\n (b)     to any risk that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings (and in \\nparticular to how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral \\nevidence),\\n (c)     in appropriate cases, to the fact that a direction under section 19 of the Youth Justice and Criminal \\nEvidence Act 1999 (special measures for the giving of evidence by fearful witnesses etc) could be made in \\nrelation to the relevant person, and\\n (d)     to any other relevant circumstances.\\n(5)     A condition set out in any paragraph of subsection (2) which is in fact satisfied is to be treated as not satisfied \\nif it is shown that the circumstances described in that paragraph are caused— in order to prevent the relevant \\nperson giving oral evidence in the proceedings (whether at all or in connection with the subject matter of the \\nstatement).\\n (a)     by the person in support of whose case it is sought to give the statement in evidence, or\\n (b)     by a person acting on his behalf,\\n123. —\\n(1) Nothing in section 116, 119 or 120 makes a statement admissible as evidence if it was made by a person who \\ndid not have the required capability at the time when he made the statement.\\n(2)     Nothing in section 117 makes a statement admissible as evidence if any person who, in order for the \\nrequirements of section 117(2) to be satisfied, must at any time have supplied or received the information \\nconcerned or created or received the document or part concerned—\\n (a)     did not have the required capability at that time, or\\n (b)     cannot be identified but cannot reasonably be assumed to have had the required capability at that time.\\n(3)     For the purposes of this section a person has the required capability if he is capable of—\\n (a)     understanding questions put to him about the matters stated, and\\n (b)     giving answers to such questions which can be understood.\\n(4)     Where by reason of this section there is an issue as to whether a person had the required capability when he \\nmade a statement—\\n (a)     proceedings held for the determination of the issue must take place in the absence of the jury (if there is \\none);Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\n (b)     in determining the issue the court may receive expert evidence and evidence from any person to whom \\nthe statement in question was made;\\n (c)     the burden of proof on the issue lies on the party seeking to adduce the statement, and the standard of \\nproof is the balance of probabilities.\\nF17.9\\nFirst-hand Hearsay from Identifiable Witness The CJA 2003, s. 116, applies only to first-hand hearsay. Where a \\nperson makes a statement, but it is not clear whether the statement is based on personal knowledge or to \\nsomething the maker has been told, the s. 116 statement should therefore not be admitted (JP [1999] Crim LR 401, \\ndecided under the CJA 1988, s. 23). Under the CJA 2003, multiple hearsay may be admissible under s. 121 (see \\nF17.84), and documents admissible under s. 117 (see F17.25) may also contain more than one degree of hearsay. \\nThe requirement that the oral evidence of the person who made the statement would have been admissible as \\nevidence of the matter (s. 116(1)(a)) also serves to ensure that hearsay cannot be received if the evidence would \\nhave been inadmissible for some other reason, e.g., that it is evidence of bad character that is not admissible under \\nthe CJA 2003, Part 11, ch. 1 (see F13 and F15).\\nThe person who made the hearsay statement must be identifiable (s. 116(1)(b)) so that those seeking to challenge \\nits credibility must be able to ascertain who made it, and be able where appropriate to invoke s. 124 (see F17.86), \\nwhich is provided by way of a substitute to the right of cross-examination. In Nkemayang [2005] EWCA Crim 1937, \\nthe Court of Appeal approved of the insistence in the CJA 2003 on strict proof of identity, saying that 'any regime \\ncontrolling the admissibility of evidence must be alert to the danger of fabricated evidence'. In Mayers [2008] EWCA \\nCrim 2989, [2009] 2 All ER 145 the Court of Appeal held that the language of s. 116(1)(b) clearly anticipates the \\ndisclosure of the identity of the maker of the statement to the defence; it follows that s. 116 cannot be applied to \\nanonymous witnesses. (See, as to preserving anonymity where a witness gives evidence, the CAJA 2009, ss. 86 to \\n90, at D14.88 et seq.) In Ford [2010] EWCA Crim 2250, an unknown witness to a shooting had stated that he \\nwished to remain anonymous, but had handed the police a note containing the registration number of the getaway \\ncar. It was held, following Mayers, that the note was inadmissible. A statement by a witness whose identity is \\nunknown might, according to Brown (Nico) [2019] EWCA Crim 1143, [2019] 2 Cr App R 25 (271) (see F17.52), be \\nreceived instead under the common law of res gestae (see F17.49) or under the 'interests of justice' exception in s. \\n114(1)(d) (see F17.34), but it would appear from Ford that neither exception can be invoked so as to allow \\nwitnesses to choose to provide evidence anonymously, for fear of subverting the statutory scheme in the CAJA \\n2009. Ford was distinguished in Brown (Nico) where it was said that, if that decision is correct, it applies only to \\ncases where the witness has expressed a preference to remain anonymous, and not to untraceable witnesses. In \\nthat case a woman on a bus had assisted a witness making an emergency call by providing the number of a car \\ndriven by a man who had stabbed the victim, but it proved impossible to trace her. The evidence she provided was \\nadmissible under both the res gestae and s. 114(1)(d).\\nF17.10\\nOral and Documentary Statements Admissible Applications under s. 116 most frequently concern statements in \\ndocuments, but oral hearsay statements may also be tendered, as may statements made by conduct (for the \\nmeaning of 'statement' see s. 115(2) at F16.7). In Musone [2007] EWCA Crim 1237, [2007] 1 WLR 2467, a man \\nwho had been stabbed was asked 'what's happened, mate?' and replied 'Musone's just stabbed me'. The statement \\nwas admitted at D's trial for murder under s. 116. By the same token, a gesture or sign language similarly \\nidentifying the guilty party could be received.\\nF17.11\\nAbsence Caused by Party Tendering Statement Section 116(5) prevents a person from being able to rely on any \\nhearsay statement by a potential witness where that person, or someone acting on that person's behalf, is \\nresponsible for the absence of the witness in order to prevent the witness from testifying. In Rowley [2012] EWCA \\nCrim 1434, [2013] 1 WLR 895, the defence was prevented from adducing the record of interview with T, who had \\nbeen threatened by D and had subsequently fled abroad. D subsequently wished to refer to aspects of T's Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\nstatement that were favourable to the defence, after the prosecution had decided not to adduce it. Section 116(5) \\nprevented him from doing so. The threat did not have to be the main or primary cause of the witness's absence, \\nprovided it was at least one of the effective causes. To hold otherwise would significantly undermine the policy of \\nthe legislation. Further, the provision was not limited to steps taken by the accused after the commencement of \\nproceedings, provided they were done with the intent of preventing the attendance of the witness at the \\nproceedings. In C [2019] EWCA Crim 623, [2019] 2 Cr App R 11 (88), it was confirmed that s. 116(5) is directed \\nagainst a party to the proceedings, and does not apply to evidence of a complainant who had 'caused' her own \\nabsence by committing suicide.\\nF17.12\\nProof of Unavailability of Maker The reasons specified in the CJA 2003, s. 116(2), for not calling the maker of a \\nstatement are disjunctive: provided that the party seeking to rely on the statement can establish that one of the \\nreasons exists, it does not matter that other reasons cannot be made out. The criminal standard of proof applies to \\nthe proof of the conditions of admissibility under s. 116 (see, e.g., Shabir [2012] EWCA Crim 2564); this point was \\nestablished under previous similar legislation in Minors [1989] 2 All ER 208 and has not subsequently been \\ndoubted. The standard of proof to be achieved by the defence is the ordinary civil standard of proof on a balance of \\nprobability (Mattey [1995] 2 Cr App R 409).\\nF17.13\\nDeath and Unfitness to be a Witness Where a witness has died, as for example in Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, \\n[2013] 1 All ER 349, the court may move straight to the consideration of whether the principles of trial fairness \\npermit the witness's statement to be adduced (see F17.89). In the case of a witness who is said to be unfit, further \\ninvestigation is required to ensure that the condition is satisfied. In Bennett, an appeal heard with Riat, the \\nstatement of a mentally disordered woman who claimed to have been assaulted by a community psychiatric nurse \\nwas held to have been rightly received under s. 116(2)(b) of the CJA 2003. The provision focuses not on the \\nphysical act of attending at court, but on the fitness of the witness when there to give evidence, and includes \\nunfitness through any mental condition. The provision is thus satisfied if the witness could be brought to court but \\nthere would be no point in doing so. Evidence indicating a medical condition made worse by stress, but not \\nindicating clearly that the witness is unfit, is not sufficient (McEwan v DPP [2007] EWHC 740 (Admin)). However, \\nthe judge is entitled when determining unfitness to take account of likely future consequences such as the risk that \\ngiving evidence will precipitate the witness's suicide (Chalk [2015] EWCA Crim 1053). It is not necessary to prove \\nmental illness: unfitness caused by the trauma of being the victim of a sexual assault may qualify (AC [2014] EWCA \\nCrim 371). Under the previous legislation, which was in similar terms, when a witness was unable to recollect \\nrelevant events, and medical evidence established that the cause was a mental disorder giving rise to great anxiety \\nand failure of recall when under stress, the conditions of admissibility were satisfied (Setz-Dempsey (1994) 98 Cr \\nApp R 23). Other pertinent authorities under the 1988 Act include Elliott [2003] EWCA Crim 1695, where it was held \\nthat, where the defence can point to proper grounds for wishing to cross-examine a doctor who testifies to the \\nunfitness of a patient, it is right to make an opportunity available for them to do so. The effect of the witness's \\nmental condition at the time the statement was made is, of course, a factor relevant to whether it should be \\nexcluded under s. 123 for lack of capability (see F17.23). In Eljack [2019] EWCA Crim 1038, V, the victim of an \\nassault, had serious long-term mental health issues and suffered from delusions. His doctor's evidence was that \\ngiving evidence in person would exacerbate his condition, but that he was capable of giving a witness statement: if \\naffected by delusion when doing so, this would have been readily apparent. It was held that V's statement was \\nrightly admitted as hearsay. A further argument that, because V had himself been found fit to stand trial on a \\nprevious occasion, he could not be unfit to testify, was rejected: 'They are different tests which can self-evidently \\nlead to different results'.\\nThe sudden unfitness of a witness who is hospitalised may be good reason for refusing an adjournment, but not for \\nrefusing to consider an application under s. 116 (CPS v Uxbridge Magistrates [2007] EWHC 205 (Admin)). Where a \\nwitness becomes unfit during cross- examination then, in deciding whether the trial is in consequence unfair, the \\ntrial judge is entitled to bear in mind that a witness's whole evidence could have been received under s. 116 \\n(Lawless [2011] EWCA Crim 59, and see further as to cross-examination F7.7).Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\nAn application to admit an accused's hearsay statement may succeed in the (very rare) case where the accused is \\nfit to stand trial, but unfit to give sworn evidence for the defence. In Hamberger [2017] EWCA Crim 273, [2017] 2 Cr \\nApp R 9 (81), the impairment to D giving evidence in the normal way was his chronic angina. The trial judge \\nindicated that various arrangements could be made to assist the appellant in giving evidence, including the contents \\nof any defence statement being used in accordance with s. 116. In the event, D advanced no positive defence. On \\nappeal it was contended that the provisions of the CJA 1982, s. 72 (see F4.12), which require any evidence given \\nby the accused to be on oath, effectively precluded the use of such hearsay evidence, but it was held that s. 72 has \\nno application to the case where the evidence is tendered in hearsay form. The use of such hearsay would be 'rare \\nand exceptional': less extreme measures to accommodate a defendant who is unwell might include allowing sworn \\nevidence to be given from a place other than the witness box, permitting frequent breaks, or restricting the duration \\nor terms of cross-examination. But as a matter of principle the terms of s. 116 are 'sufficiently wide to enable the \\ncourt to permit a defendant who is genuinely unable to give oral testimony to put his account before the jury by way \\nof hearsay'.\\nF17.14\\nOutside the UK and Not Reasonably Practicable to Secure Attendance or Cannot be Found after \\nReasonable Steps The evidence that must be provided to lay a foundation in these two cases is essentially what it \\nis 'reasonable' to expect a party to do, whether that involves taking steps to secure the attendance of a person who \\nis known to be abroad, or to find a person whose whereabouts are unknown. What is reasonable depends on the \\ncircumstances, but it is important that the prosecution should be in a position to provide a sufficiently compelling \\nand detailed reason for the absence of any witness to satisfy the requirements of a fair trial. In Price v UK (2017) 64 \\nEHRR 17 (877), while the authorities had made 'significant efforts' to persuade a reluctant witness based in \\nAntwerp to testify, the ECtHR said that it could reach 'no firm conclusion' as to whether all reasonable steps had \\nbeen taken in the absence of more detailed submissions as to the reasons why the prosecution had not had \\nrecourse to further measures which may have been available (in that case, by virtue of the EU Convention on \\nMutual Assistance in Criminal Matters). While the absence of good reason is not (and was not in Price v UK) \\nconclusive on the question whether a trial has been fair, it is an important factor.\\nF17.15\\nIn a number of cases the courts have emphasised the importance of keeping track of witnesses and their \\npreparedness to testify in relation to both the CJA 2003, s. 116(2)(c) and (d). In C [2006] EWCA Crim 1079, [2006] \\n1 WLR 2994, where a key prosecution witness who was in South Africa had a last-minute change of heart about \\nattending the trial, it was said that what was reasonably practicable must be judged in the light of the steps taken by \\nthe party seeking to secure the attendance of the witness and that further inquiries as to the reasons for the \\nwitness's refusal should have been made. It was also said to be appropriate to provide evidence of whether the \\nwitness's account could have been secured by video link or by some other method that permits a degree of \\nchallenge by the defence, a point also made in Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349, where Hughes \\nLJ said that absence abroad will satisfy the condition in s. 116(2)(c) 'only if it is not reasonably practicable to bring \\nthe witness to court, either in person or by video link'. In McEvoy [2016] EWCA Crim 1654 the evidence of two \\nGerman university students was 'pivotal' to whether a child had been indecently assaulted, but no efforts had been \\nmade by German police to contact them via their home or university addresses in the two months before the trial. It \\nfollowed that their evidence should not have been read.\\nSimilar considerations apply to witnesses who cannot be found. In Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER \\n349 Hughes LJ said, '[i]f the witness is lost, all reasonably practicable steps must have been taken to get him before \\nthe court: this will include not only looking for him if he disappears but also keeping in touch with him to avoid him \\ndisappearing'. In DT [2009] EWCA Crim 1213, the absent witness claimed that the accused, charged with causing \\ngrievous bodily harm, had confessed to her. The statement was an important part of the prosecution case, and it \\nwas apparent from the time it was made that the witness intended not to give evidence. Yet no attempt was made \\nto prove what steps the police had taken to keep contact with her, through the Witness Care Programme, to explain \\nher civic duty to her, or to try and find where she had gone in the months before the trial. It was said to be hopeless \\nto expect a judge to say that such steps as were reasonably practicable had been taken, and the court expressed Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\nconcern that trials were proceeding without formal inquiry (or at least an agreed statement of facts) on which to \\nbase a decision on admissibility. In Shah [2010] EWCA Crim 2326, it was said that to tell a judge that a witness \\ncannot be traced carries with it the implication that efforts have been made to trace the witness. If no such efforts \\nhave been made, the judge is being misled.\\nIn Adams [2007] EWCA Crim 3025, [2008] 1 Cr App R 35 (430), it was held that reasonable steps within the \\nmeaning of s. 116(2)(d) had not been taken in relation to a witness with whom there was no contact in the four \\nmonths from the time when the trial date was fixed until the Friday before it started, when a message was left on his \\nmobile phone to which he did not respond. This 'fell a long way short of what was, in practice, needed to get \\nwitnesses to attend court', although in that case, exceptionally, the evidence was admitted under s. 114(1)(d) (see \\nF17.39). Adams was considered in Murphy [2014] EWCA Crim 1457, where the prosecution had lost touch with the \\nwitness until just before the trial, but then made efforts to ensure his attendance, including seeking a witness \\nsummons which was served on him before he disappeared leaving no address. It was held that the judge was \\nentitled to conclude that the prosecution had taken reasonable steps, which was ultimately a question of fact. To \\nsimilar effect is Barnes [2020] EWCA Crim 959, where the witness appeared to be prepared to give evidence, albeit \\nwith special measures, until just before the re-arranged trial date, at which point steps were taken to serve a \\nwitness summons and to track down the witness, who had moved away. The Court of Appeal observed (at [18]) that \\n'there is a limit in any given case as to what is or is not “reasonably practicable”'. In Jones (Kane) [2015] EWCA \\nCrim 1317, the complainant in an incident of significant domestic violence had disappeared, taking her children with \\nher. It appeared that no steps had been taken to secure her attendance despite ongoing concerns about her \\nwelfare, and various indications that she might not appear. It was held that the process by which her evidence had \\nbeen admitted at trial had not complied with the safeguards anticipated by the CJA 2003. This was not simply \\nattributable to the fact that the application had been made erroneously under s. 114(1)(d) (see F17.34) instead of s. \\n116, because both provisions required an investigation into the reasons why the witness could not attend the trial. \\nAs a matter of due diligence there were practical measures that could have been adopted to ensure the location \\nand attendance of the complainant, and to protect her, while ensuring the defence had the opportunity to cross-\\nexamine the complainant. The fact that to embark upon those measures would have meant a delay in the \\ncommencement of the trial or would otherwise have imposed upon the police officers concerned the necessity to \\ntrack down the complainant did not provide a sufficient basis upon which to admit the evidence in hearsay form.\\nF17.16\\nIn relation to the proof of the conditions of admissibility it was held in Case [1991] Crim LR 192 that, where the only \\n'evidence' to support the contention that the maker of the statement was out of the country was the statement itself \\n(which was, of course, inadmissible hearsay until proved otherwise), the statement ought not to have been \\nadmitted. In Mattey [1995] 2 Cr App R 409, where the statement, which was tendered by the defence, had only to \\nsatisfy the condition on a balance of probabilities, it was held inadmissible in part because hearsay was relied on in \\nsupport of it, but the hearsay may have been admissible evidence of the state of mind of the maker, so that Case \\nwas distinguishable. Both Case and Mattey were decided under previous legislation but the authorities remain \\npersuasive.\\nIn a significant number of the cases dealt with by s. 116(2)(c) and (d), the absent witness will not simply have gone \\nabroad or gone missing but will be deliberately avoiding the proceedings. In DT [2009] EWCA Crim 1213, the Court \\nof Appeal drew a parallel between these cases and absence through fear (see F17.17), saying: 'It is important that \\nall efforts are made to get the witness to court; this must start with the witness being given all possible support and \\nmade to understand the importance of the citizen's duty to give evidence.' The importance of the right of \\nconfrontation has implications for the court's inquiry into what is 'reasonably practicable' for s. 116(2)(c) or \\nconstitutes 'reasonable steps in s. 116(2)(d) as well as in relation to the question whether the powers of the court to \\nensure fairness (see F17.7 and F17.88) should be exercised to exclude the statement. As to the application of the \\nPACE 1984, s. 78, where a central prosecution witness is absent during the trial, see Kiziltan [2017] EWCA Crim \\n1461, [2018] 4 WLR 43 at F17.90.\\nF17.17Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\nFear The terms of the CJA 2003, s. 116(2)(e), do not require that the fear must be attributable to the accused, nor \\ndoes the ECHR, Article 6, so require (Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373: see the Court of Appeal \\njudgment endorsed and regarded as complementary to the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court). It follows \\nthat an accused cannot complain of the use of an absent witness's statement where it is fear of a co-accused that \\nhas caused a prosecution witness to take flight (Harvey [2014] EWCA Crim 54). However, a causal link between the \\nfear and the failure or refusal to give evidence must be proved, and how it is proved depends upon the background \\ntogether with the history and circumstances of the particular case. (Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER \\n349; Shabir [2012] EWCA Crim 2564). The Crown Court Compendium, ch. 14-2, emphasises that, while it is in \\nmany cases possible for the jury to be told the reasons for a witness's absence, this cannot generally be done in \\ncases involving fear.\\nThe previous statement of a hostile prosecution witness who is motivated simply by the desire to protect the \\naccused, rather than by fear, remains outside the purview of s. 116, but may be admissible under s. 119 (see \\nF6.47) or s. 114(1)(d) (see F17.34 and Muldoon [2021] EWCA Crim 381 at F17.37). Where fear appears to be only \\none factor in a witness's refusal to testify, it is necessary to evaluate other possible reasons. In Nelson [2009] \\nEWCA Crim 1600, the witness was also angry at what she perceived to be the failures of the witness protection \\nsystem, and anxious about the symptoms of a serious illness and a related medical appointment she had missed \\nbecause she was forced to attend the court. More should have been done to ascertain the witness's reasons for \\nrefusing to testify; the outcome of further investigation might have led the judge to deal differently with her.\\nThe extent to which s. 116 can apply to the statement of a witness who subsequently gives evidence is unclear. In \\nClarke [2012] EWCA Crim 2354, the victim of a violent burglary testified that he did not recognise his attacker, but \\nhe had told a police officer 'off the record' that it was D and there was evidence that he was afraid of what D, a \\nviolent man, might do. The Court of Appeal declined to decide whether the officer's evidence was rightly admitted at \\ntrial but it seems unlikely that the wording of the provision was intended to stretch that far, as the witness had given \\nevidence on the point, albeit unfavourable evidence. The wording clearly does anticipate the case of the witness \\nwho 'dries up' through fear, before getting through the matters proved by the statement, but that was not the case in \\nClarke.\\nSection 116(3) makes it clear that fear is to be 'widely construed' and that it includes, for example, fear of injury to \\nanother or fear of financial loss. It was at one time thought that courts would be 'ill-advised to seek to test the basis \\nof fear by calling witnesses before them' (Davies [2006] EWCA Crim 2643, [2007] 2 All ER 1070). This, however, \\nmay be too weak a response in the majority of cases to satisfy the 'fair trial' concern that hearsay evidence is not \\nadmitted unless it is necessary to do so. In Shabir the Court of Appeal endorsed the view that every effort must be \\nmade to get the witness to court to test the issue of 'fear' with a view, if at all possible, to persuading the witness to \\ngive evidence, and in Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349 it was said that 'a degree of (properly \\nsupported) fortitude can legitimately be expected in the fight against crime'. In some cases a witness alleging 'fear' \\nmay be cross-examined by the defence, with 'special measures' in place to assist the witness if necessary. In other \\ncases that procedure may not be appropriate (to borrow the example in Riat, 'in some cases of alleged domestic \\nviolence it may be an avenue for worsening apprehension'). In Harvey [2014] EWCA Crim 54 the Court of Appeal \\nrelied both on Shabir and the relevant passage from Davies, implicitly suggesting that there might still be some \\ncases in which the court should not seek to test the fear where the purpose of the section would be undermined. \\nHence the current rule is probably that the court will consider whether there is a particular reason not to follow the \\nmeasures suggested in Shabir, for example where there is evidence other than that of the fearful witness of a threat \\nto life or limb. In the majority of cases, however, the requirement for leave to be obtained is a further reason to \\njustify a close scrutiny of the impact of the fear on the witness, which should be tested in court where possible (see \\nF17.21).\\nF17.18\\nThe proof of fear may itself give rise to questions of admissibility. In Neill v North Antrim Magistrates' Court [1992] 4 \\nAll ER 846, decided under previous legislation, two boys made statements to the police in which they claimed to \\nhave witnessed an assault and to have identified one of the perpetrators. However, they did not attend the \\nsubsequent committal proceedings, and evidence was given by a police officer that the boys' mothers had told him Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\nthat the boys were too afraid to attend. The House of Lords held that the statements should not have been received \\nbecause the evidence of the officer was hearsay, being based on what he had been told by the mothers of the boys \\nand not by the boys themselves. If the boys had communicated their fears to him directly he could have given \\nevidence of what they had told him under the 'long-established law that a person's declaration of his \\ncontemporaneous state of mind is admissible to prove the existence of that state of mind', per Lord Mustill at p. \\n1228 following Blastland [1986] AC 41 (see now the CJA 2003, s. 118(1), at F17.78). However, the point was also \\nmade that, even had such evidence been available, a court would be cautious about whether it was in the interests \\nof justice to admit documentary evidence of identification or recognition that formed the principal element in the \\nprosecution's case: a point that might now be made with equal force in relation to the risk of unfairness under s. \\n116(4) (see F17.21).\\nAs to proof of fear by hearsay evidence forming part of the res gestae, see F17.49. An alternative might be to admit \\nthe proof of the witness's fear under the CJA 2003, s. 114(1)(d) ('the interests of justice' exception: see F17.34).\\nF17.19\\nThe evidence of fear must relate to the relevant time. In H [2001] Crim LR 815, decided under previous legislation, \\nthe alleged victim of a kidnapping made a statement two months before the trial indicating his fear of reprisals and \\nhis intention to abscond, but he in fact remained in the area and was arrested in connection with drugs offences. No \\nevidence of continuing fear was adduced at the trial. Stressing that the fear must be judged at the time of the trial, \\nand that the out-of-date evidence was not by itself sufficient, the Court of Appeal also acknowledged that there \\nmight be a 'degree of sensible give and take', for example when a ruling on admissibility was sought in advance of \\ntrial to enable counsel for the prosecution to decide how the case should be opened to the jury.\\nF17.20\\nIntimidation in Fear Cases If the reason for the witness's failure to give evidence in person is that the witness was \\nintimidated by or on behalf of the accused, who then contests the admissibility of the statement for the prosecution, \\nthe accused is in a weak position to claim infringement of the right to a fair trial. The point is strongly made in Al-\\nKhawaja and Tahery v UK (2012) 54 EHRR 23 (807), where it was said that to allow the accused to engender the \\nfear and then to benefit from it would be incompatible with the rights of victims and 'no court could be expected to \\nallow the integrity of its proceedings to be subverted in this way'. But the problem posed by intimidation of \\nwitnesses, for example by organised criminals, does not provide a licence to prosecutors to resort to proof by \\nhearsay (Arnold [2004] EWCA Crim 1293), and the conditions of admissibility must be established in the same way \\nand to the same extent as in other cases where a witness is in fear. In Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All \\nER 349 (in the appeal of Wilson), specific evidence of fear was not put before the court, and the judge relied \\nprincipally on the 'real culture of intimidation' that was prevalent in the area where the witness lived. The Court of \\nAppeal considered that the evidence had been wrongly admitted: this was a case in which the witnesses could have \\nbeen brought to court and the possibility that they might have given evidence, if only as hostile witnesses, could not \\nhave been ruled out. By contrast, in Fagan [2012] EWCA Crim 2248, where there was clear evidence that the \\nwitness had been subject to intimidation by someone acting on behalf of the accused, the failure of the prosecution \\nto make attempts to bring the witness to court was 'nowhere near fatal' to the judge's conclusion that the evidence \\nshould be admitted. In Boulton [2007] EWCA Crim 942 the complainant in a case of rape attended a hearing to \\nexplain her reluctance to testify in light of serious threats on behalf of the accused and a long history of violence \\nand intimidation. When reminded of her civic duty, she responded, 'I am not averse to duty, your Honour I am just \\naverse to martyrdom'. The Court of Appeal not only upheld the judge's decision but doubted whether any other \\nconclusion was possible.\\nNote that, by virtue of the CJA 2003, s. 116(5) (see F17.8 and F17.10), an accused who causes the absence of a \\nwitness is also prevented from adducing the witness's statement as hearsay as part of the defence case.\\nF17.21\\nLeave in Fear Cases In Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373, in a judgment endorsed and regarded as \\ncomplementary to the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal stressed that all possible Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\nefforts should be made to get the witness to court, bearing in mind the importance of the right to confrontation and \\nthat intimidation will only flourish if citizens are readily discouraged from doing their duty. If the circumstances are \\nsuch that the defence cannot cross-examine the witness to test the relevant matters, it is incumbent on the judge to \\ninvestigate all possibilities by which the witness might give oral evidence (Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All \\nER 349; Shabir [2012] EWCA Crim 2564). See also Fagan [2012] EWCA Crim 2248 (where it is recognised that a \\nconclusion of intimidation may still be reached without producing the witness in court), Claridge [2013] EWCA Crim \\n203 (where it was said to be a 'counsel to perfection' to expect inquiry to be made of the witness, who was in court, \\nabout whether she could be persuaded to testify, but the failure to do so did not threaten the safety of the \\nconviction), and Min Fu [2017] EWCA Crim 248 (where L, the absent witness, was alleged to be the victim of a \\nprotection racket and afraid of reprisals). The reception of L's hearsay testimony deprived D of the ability to cross-\\nexamine L as to whether D had behaved threateningly towards him, but the Court of Appeal accepted that the judge \\nwas entitled to take the view he did, although other judges might have taken more positive steps to get L into court. \\nOne factor was the existence of CCTV footage that appeared to show D directing a violent attack against L. Note \\nalso Jabbar [2013] EWCA Crim 801 and compare Lawrence [2013] EWCA Crim 708, [2014] 1 Cr App R 5 (33), \\ndiscussed at F17.38.\\nWitnesses should never be assured in advance that their evidence will be read (Horncastle at [81]). In deciding \\nwhether to give leave under the CJA 2003, s. 116(4), to admit the statement of a fearful witness, the court is \\nexpressly directed to take into account, along with any other circumstances it regards as relevant, the content of the \\nstatement, the risk that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness having regard to the difficulty of \\nchallenging the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence, and the possibility that a special \\nmeasures direction under the YJCEA 1999 (see D14.3) could be made in relation to that person. This last condition \\ndirects the court's attention to the possibility that fear may in some cases be assuaged by the application of special \\nmeasures, e.g., by the use of screens, live-link or video-recorded evidence. These alternatives are preferable to \\nhearsay because the witness is made available to be cross-examined. Thus in Robinson v Sutton Coldfield \\nMagistrates' Court [2006] EWHC 307 (Admin), [2006] 4 All ER 1029, where the complainant in a case of assault \\n(D's former partner) had begun a new life and did not wish D to be able to trace her, it was necessary for the \\njustices, before receiving her evidence, to consider whether any of the 1999 Act's special measures might meet the \\ncase. The possibility that special arrangements could have been made to convey her to court without enabling D to \\ndiscover where she was living might also have been relevant to the overall question of the interests of justice. In \\nDoherty [2006] EWCA Crim 2716, the exercise to be undertaken under s. 116(4) was described as 'not strictly an \\nexercise of discretion but something akin to it', and one which the judge is in the best position to perform. Issues of \\ntrial fairness, including an alleged infringement of the ECHR, Article 6(3)(d), can conveniently be subsumed within \\nthe s. 116(4) inquiry, but ultimately the issues are the same in fear cases as in other cases of challenge for \\nunfairness based on Horncastle: see F17.89 et seq. — many of the leading cases considered there involve fearful \\nwitnesses.\\nF17.22\\nRelevance of Availability of Other Evidence Where the disputed hearsay evidence is the 'sole or decisive' \\nevidence for the prosecution, the court must pay particular attention to Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC \\n373and the considerations outlined at F17.89 et seq. Although the court cannot require to be told whether the \\naccused intends to give evidence or call witnesses, it is not bound to assess the possibility of challenging the \\nstatement upon the basis that the accused will do neither of these things. In Doherty [2006] EWCA Crim 2716, the \\ncourt was influenced not only by the strength of the other evidence of the assault but also by the prospect of \\nwitnesses being called who could support the accused's version of events.\\nF17.23\\nCompetence of Maker of Statement A statement by a witness who lacks the competence to testify at the time the \\nstatement was made may not be received under the CJA 2003, s. 116 (see s. 123 at F17.8). Such a statement \\nmight, if the interests of justice required it, be admissible under s. 114(1)(d) (see F17.34). Under the previous law \\n(CJA 1988, s. 23), evidence of an incompetent witness was received in D [2002] EWCA Crim 990, [2003] QB 90, \\nbut it is likely to be only in a rare case that this is appropriate.Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 116: Unavailable Witnesses\\nF17.24\\nCredibility Section 124 of the CJA 2003 (see F17.87) applies in relation to matters bearing on the credibility of the \\nmakers of hearsay statements admissible under s. 116. It is of particular importance to consider whether, and if so \\nby what evidence, the party against whom hearsay evidence is given under s. 116 will be able to challenge it.\\n\"]\n",

Where the \\nreliability of the statement is, contrary to normal expectation, doubtful (whether as a result of its contents, the source \\nof the information, or concerns about the manner in which the document came into being), the court has a specific \\npower under s. 117(7) to direct the exclusion of a document that is otherwise admissible under s. 117, whether \\ntendered by the prosecution or the defence.\\nSection 117 of the CJA 2003 extends, as did its predecessor (s. 24 of the CJA 1998), to documents created or \\nreceived by a person in the course of a trade, business, profession or other occupation, or as the holder of a paid or \\nunpaid office. Section 117 goes further in that it applies also to parts of documents so created, when the statement \\nin issue is included in that part (for the meaning of 'statement' see s. 115(2) at F16.7) In Clowes [1992] 3 All ER \\n440, decided under the CJA 1988, s. 24, transcripts of interviews between the liquidators of companies and persons \\ninvolved with the companies were held to have been 'received' by the liquidators in the course of their profession \\nand as holders of the office of liquidator. Documents of a non-commercial nature such as a National Health Service \\nhospital's records are clearly admissible, as is the transcript of the evidence given by a witness at an earlier trial, \\nwhich may be admitted at a retrial even though the court is plainly not a business in any sense (Lockley [1995] 2 Cr \\nApp R 554). Similarly, a police custody record was admitted under s. 24 in Hogan [1997] Crim LR 349. In Johnson \\n[2019] EWCA Crim 1730, medical records in which the complainant had disclosed a sexual assault by D were \\nadmitted under the CJA 2003, s. 117, to rebut a suggestion of recent fabrication.\\nBecause s. 117, like s. 24 before it, applies only to documentary evidence, the compiler of documents for use in \\ncriminal proceedings who leaves out important details of information obtained from others who do not give evidence \\ncannot simply supplement the record with oral hearsay testimony (Hinds [1993] Crim LR 528). Nor can an entry in a \\nrecord be proved simply by calling someone who has checked the record (Motor Depot Ltd and Williams v Kingston \\nupon Hull City Council [2012] EWHC 3257 (Admin)), a principle that appears to have been breached in Grazette v \\nDPP [2012] EWHC 3863 (Admin).\\nF17.27\\nIn Foxley [1995] 2 Cr App R 523, decided under the CJA 1988, s. 24, the documents in question were copies of \\ncredit notes and payments allegedly made by overseas companies to D, who was accused of receiving them \\ncorruptly. They had been obtained by letters of request to the authorities in the relevant countries. It was objected, \\ninter alia, that no evidence was available from the creator as to whether these documents had come into existence \\nin the course of a business etc., but it was held to be the intention of the statute that the court be allowed to draw \\nrelevant inferences from the documents themselves and from the way in which they had been placed before the \\ncourt. Likewise, in O'Connor [2010] EWCA Crim 2287, Belgian telephone records were procured through letters of \\nrequest, but no accompanying statement as to the method of compilation was forthcoming. It was held that, to the \\nextent that the documents may have been statements by a person (rather than non-hearsay mechanically produced \\nevidence: see F16.11) it was open to the judge to draw inferences that their compilation had been in accordance \\nwith the provisions of s. 117. On the face of the documents, it could be inferred that the compiler had been either an \\nemployee of the phone provider or an officer of the Belgian police. Nothing in s. 117 required the production of an \\nexplanatory statement, though it may well often be desirable to have one. In Department of Environment, Food and \\nRural Affairs v Atkinson [2002] EWHC 2028 (Admin), the label on a bottle was held to be admissible evidence that it Business and Other Documents\\ncontained a veterinary medicinal product, applying the same inference of reliability from the context. A case that \\nmay go too far in this context is Grazette v DPP [2012] EWHC 3863 (Admin), where an inference was drawn as to \\nthe likelihood that the anonymous supplier of information to a Criminal Intelligence Report as to the 'street name' of \\nthe accused was correct because the address given for him in the same report was correct.\\nF17.28\\nPersonal Knowledge The 'supplier' of the information (who must have, etc., personal knowledge of the matters \\ndealt with under the CJA 2003, s. 117(2)(b)) may also be the person who 'creates' the document under s. 117(2)(c) \\n(s. 117(3)). Thus, for example, a note made by an operator working for a paging company that messages had been \\nleft for a customer would be admissible (as in Rock [1994] Crim LR 843, decided under the 1988 Act) as a first-\\nhand hearsay statement. Where such a document is received in evidence under s. 117, it is not necessary, as it is \\nunder s. 116 (see F17.8), to prove the unavailability of the maker of the statement.\\nSection 117 may also be invoked where several degrees of hearsay are involved. Provided each of the persons \\nthrough whom the information was supplied received it in the course of a trade etc. (s. 117(2)(c)), the facts stated in \\nthe document are admissible. See, e.g., Wellington v DPP [2007] EWHC 1061 (Admin) (extract from Police National \\nComputer printout recording previous use of same alias by accused). In Maher v DPP [2006] EWHC 1271 (Admin) \\na note which had been made (and lost) of a car number plate could not be adduced as second-hand evidence \\nunder s. 117 because a relevant passer-on of information had not received it in the course of their trade etc. The \\nevidence was, however, admitted under s. 121(1)(c) as multiple hearsay, on the ground that the value of the \\nevidence, taking into account its apparent reliability, was so high that the interests of justice required admissibility. \\nThis apparent incongruity can be explained on the basis that admissibility under s. 117 is 'automatic' (subject to the \\ndiscretion in s. 117(6) and (7)), hence the need to demonstrate the degree of reliability inherent in the making of a \\ncommercial type of record. The ruling in favour of admissibility in Maher is based on the determination that the \\nparticular record, though not automatically admissible, was (on investigation of its specific properties) sufficiently \\nreliable and important to be received. However, the process by which it was received ought to have included the \\ndetermination that the passing-on of the information was itself hearsay admissible under s. 114(1)(d) (see F17.34 \\nand F17.85).\\nF17.29\\nA document produced by a computer without any human intervention cannot be said to contain information \\n'supplied by a person' with 'personal knowledge' (Pettigrew (1980) 71 Cr App R 39). However, as such a document \\ndoes not constitute hearsay evidence, it will not matter that the conditions of the exception cannot be satisfied \\n(Wood (1982) 76 Cr App R 23, considered at F16.12 et seq.).\\nThe statement is admissible only as evidence of any matter stated of which 'oral evidence given in the proceedings' \\nwould be admissible, and this prevents the introduction of evidence that contravenes a rule of admissibility other \\nthan the hearsay rule, e.g., the rule against evidence of bad character, or evidence that goes only to credit where \\nthe witness's answer is final, as in Foye [2013] EWCA Crim 475. It cannot be a valid objection to the admissibility of \\nevidence under s. 117 that an intermediary through whom the information was supplied could not have given \\nevidence of the fact without contravening the hearsay rule, otherwise s. 117 could not be made to apply to second-\\nhand hearsay, and it is clearly meant to do so (see s. 121 at F17.84).\\nF17.30\\nUnavailability of Maker of Statement Prepared for Purposes of Criminal Proceedings or Investigation It is \\nnot generally necessary to show grounds why the supplier of information contained in a statement should not be \\ncalled before tendering a statement in evidence under the CJA 2003, s. 117. The only exceptions are those \\nstatements prepared for the purposes of pending or contemplated criminal proceedings, or of a criminal \\ninvestigation (s. 117(4)(a)), which are not obtained pursuant to a request or order specified in s. 117(4)(b). Here, s. \\n117(5) applies, and it is necessary to establish either:Business and Other Documents\\n (a)     one of the reasons for not calling the relevant person that apply in the case of a s. 116 statement (s. \\n117(5)(a): see F17.11 et seq.); or\\n (b)     that the person cannot reasonably be expected (having regard to the time that has elapsed since the \\nstatement was made and to all the circumstances) to have any recollection of the matters dealt with in the \\nstatement (s. 117(5)(b)).\\nIn Minchin [2013] EWCA Crim 2412, D was charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice for providing a \\nfalse alibi for his son. The Court of Appeal accepted that a solicitor's file note recording a meeting that had taken \\nplace with D and his son was inadmissible under s. 117 as it had been prepared for the purposes of criminal \\nproceedings (s. 117(4)) and none of the statutory reasons for not calling the maker applied (s. 117(5)). However, \\nthe probative value of the note ultimately led to its admission under s. 114(1)(d) in the interests of justice (see \\nF17.38).\\nF17.31\\nIn Humphris [2005] EWCA Crim 2030, an attempt was made to use s. 117 where the prosecution sought to \\nestablish the modus operandi of previous admissible sexual offences committed by H. The details of the offences \\nwere recorded by police officers and other employees all acting under a duty, and the suggestion was that they had \\nthe necessary personal knowledge to be the 'relevant person' for the purposes of s. 117(2)(b) and (5). While the \\ncourt found no difficulty in using s. 117 to establish the fact of conviction, the details of the method used were in \\neach case dependent on information originally supplied by the complainant, who was thus the 'relevant person'. The \\ncorrect method of proceeding would therefore have been, as it was before the CJA 2003, to take a statement from \\nthe complainant. This might, depending on the circumstances, have been admissible under s. 116 (see F17.8). \\nSee, however, Ainscough [2006] EWCA Crim 694, drawing attention to the fact that a conviction might be \\ncomplicated by the fact that an accused was sentenced on a different basis as a result of a plea, proffered and \\naccepted by the court at the time. This would affect the fairness of admitting the original complainant's evidence as \\nhearsay and would raise numerous satellite issues about the detail of what occurred (see also F13.47).\\nF17.32\\nIn Bedi (1992) 95 Cr App R 21, the 'lost and stolen' reports maintained by a bank in respect of credit cards it had \\nissued were held not to fall within the equivalent provisions of the CJA 1988. An examination of the reports \\ndisclosed that they were kept for the proper conduct of the bank's business, not for criminal proceedings. In Hogan \\n[1997] Crim LR 349 it was assumed, surely rightly, that a police custody record fell within the equivalent provisions \\nof the 1988 Act, and in West Midlands Probation Board v French [2008] EWHC 2631 (Admin), [2009] 1 WLR 1715, \\nit was held that the licence setting out the conditions of a prisoner's release is not a document prepared for the \\npurposes specified by s. 117(4)(a).\\nSection 117(5)(b) may apply where a witness is unable to recollect one part of a longer statement but is able to give \\nevidence as to the rest (Carrington [1994] Crim LR 438, in which the witness's recollection was supplemented in \\nrelation to a car registration number that she had forgotten, in circumstances where she was not entitled to refresh \\nher memory from the statement). See as to the evidence that may satisfy this condition, Crayden [1978] 2 All ER \\n700 at p. 608 (decided under the Criminal Evidence Act 1965) and Feest [1987] Crim LR 766 (decided under the \\nPACE 1984).\\nF17.33\\nCompetence The CJA 2003, s. 123 (see F17.8), which provides that only evidence from competent witnesses may \\nbe received, applies to s. 117 in the following way. Where any person who supplied or received relevant \\ninformation, or who created or received the document or the part concerned, either lacked capacity or (if \\nunidentifiable) cannot reasonably be assumed to have had capacity at the relevant time, the statement may not be \\nadmitted under s. 117 (s. 123(2)). This does not necessarily preclude its admission under the interests of justice \\nexception in s. 114(1)(d), but it would be a rare case where this would be appropriate.Business and Other Documents\\n\"]\n",

Originally conceived by the Law \\nCommission as a 'safety valve' for the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence in exceptional circumstances \\nonly, there is nothing in the statutory language to indicate that this is how s. 114(1)(d) is to be used (Sak v CPS \\n[2007] EWHC 2886 (Admin), where, however, it was also stated that s. 114 should not be lightly applied). The \\ndifficulty lies in striking a balance between using the provision in circumstances where the evidence ought to be \\nadmitted but no other exception presents itself, and using it to circumvent the legitimate constraints of other \\nprovisions. In D (E) [2010] EWCA Crim 1213, it was held that the hearsay statement of a witness which was \\ntendered in order to rebut an allegation of recent fabrication was wrongly admitted where the witness was absent on \\nholiday in circumstances that did not fall within s. 116, and the role of the prosecution in failing to secure the \\nwitness's attendance was not properly considered when applying the 'interests of justice' criteria. Pitchford LJ \\nreferred to s. 114 in terms of a 'hierarchy' of exceptions; s. 114(1)(d) should not be used to circumvent requirements \\nof other gateways higher up the hierarchy. In Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373, the Supreme Court \\nreferred to s. 114(1)(d) as a 'limited residual power', which also suggests a hierarchical or 'safety-valve' approach.\\nA good recent example of the deployment of s. 114(1)(d) to fill a gap in the hierarchy concerns witnesses who adopt \\na 'silent stance' at trial. The previous statements of witnesses who have given no oral evidence with which their \\nprevious statements could be said to be inconsistent cannot be adduced under the provisions of the CJA 2003, s. \\n119 (see F6.47) and the Criminal Procedure Act 1865, s. 3 (see F6.52). Such witnesses may nevertheless be \\ntreated as hostile at common law and, under the rule in Thompson (1976) 64 Cr App R 96, may be cross-examined \\nby the party calling them (see F6.53). While there is no specific common-law power to adduce a witness's previous \\nstatement, s. 114(1)(d) may be deployed to do so (Muldoon [2021] EWCA Crim 381). The Court of Appeal was \\nclear that Muldoon was not a case in which the restrictions on hearsay evidence were being circumvented. Rather, \\n'the particular statutory and common law provisions relating to these two hostile witnesses rendered it in the \\ninterests of justice for their hearsay statements to be introduced into evidence under section 114(1)(d)' (at [48]).\\nExamples of cases where the use of s. 114(1)(d) would circumvent rules further up the hearsay hierarchy may also \\nbe found. In Z [2009] EWCA Crim 20, [2009] 1 Cr App R 34 (500), the Court of Appeal said it would be 'rare indeed' \\nto admit the hearsay account of a woman who claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the accused when a \\nchild, in support of the similar complaint for which the accused was being tried. The hearsay witness was unwilling \\nto relive the trauma of the offences by giving evidence, a ground not recognised by s. 116 (see F17.8), and the \\nCourt regarded the use of s. 114(1)(d) as an unacceptable means of circumventing the restrictions on hearsay in s. \\n116. The Court also expressed its concern at the prospect of disputed evidence of bad character being adduced in \\nhearsay form. See, to similar effect, C [2010] EWCA Crim 72, where s. 116 was not satisfied in respect of an \\nalleged victim of sexual offences, and her account should not have been presented by her adoptive mother using s. \\n114(1)(d) instead.\\nA more difficult decision to justify is Burton [2011] EWCA Crim 1990, in which the prosecution was permitted to \\nadduce the statement of a 14-year-old complainant that she had been involved in a sexual relationship with D under \\ns. 114(1)(d). Although the circumstances would not have justified the use of s. 116, it may be that the case was \\nexceptional in that the evidence was peripheral, not only in the sense that it was not the 'sole or decisive' evidence, \\nRelationship with Other Hearsay Exceptions\\nbut also that it merely served to confirm D's admissions to the police. However, in Tindle [2011] EWCA Crim 2341, \\na case of assault in which the prosecution sought in effect to circumvent their own failure to take 'reasonable steps' \\nto secure the complainant's attendance under s. 116 by tendering the evidence under s. 114(1)(d), it was held, \\napplying Z, that considering, as the court was required to do by s. 114(2)(g), whether oral evidence of the matter \\ncould have been given and, if not, why it could not was bound to lead back to the same inquiry as had led to \\nexclusion under s. 116.\\nF17.38\\nWhere evidence is inadmissible under another hearsay exception for reasons related to the interests of justice, it \\nwould clearly be inconsistent to allow s. 114(1)(d) to be invoked to arrive at a different result: see, e.g., S [2007] \\nEWCA Crim 2105 (plea of guilty of one conspirator in a closed conspiracy with D, though technically admissible \\nunder the PACE 1984, s. 74, should have been excluded under s. 78), McEwan v DPP [2007] EWHC 740 (Admin) \\n(s. 116 inapplicable because of lack of diligence by the prosecutor in securing the necessary proof) and Warnick \\n[2013] EWCA Crim 2320 (where the prosecution was unable to demonstrate that the witness was in fear for the \\npurposes of s. 116(2)(e) (see F17.17), the same evidence could not be used to admit a statement under s. \\n114(1)(d) without circumventing the 'fear' provisions). It does not follow that evidence which fails to comply with \\nconditions of another hearsay exception can never be admitted under s. 114(1)(d), as part of its purpose is to fill the \\ngap between other provisions where that is in the interests of justice. Thus in Adams [2008] 1 Cr App R 35 (430), a \\nwitness had not been given sufficient notice for the court to find that he 'could not be found after taking reasonable \\nsteps' (s. 116(2)(d): see F17.14), but the evidence was, though technically necessary, uncontentious, and the court \\nallowed proof by hearsay under s. 114(1)(d). In Sadiq [2009] EWCA Crim 712, the Court of Appeal held that the \\ntestimony of the alleged victim of a shooting, who had been paralysed and was unable to speak, could be admitted \\nunder s. 114(1)(d) at a retrial. The witness had given evidence by means of an alphabet board at the original trial, \\nbut had asserted (without giving reasons) his unwillingness to testify at the retrial. However, in Lawrence [2013] \\nEWCA Crim 708, [2014] 1 Cr App R 5 (33), the Court suggested that the reasons for refusal to give evidence at the \\nretrial would have to be considered as carefully as in fear cases under s. 116 (see F17.21) before the evidence \\ncould be admitted under s. 114(1)(d) and s. 131 (under which s. 114(1)(d) is applicable to retrials: see F17.80). In J \\n[2011] EWCA Crim 3021, the statement of a three-year-old boy as to the cause of his injuries was held to have \\nbeen rightly admitted under s. 114(1)(d) in the trial of his mother's partner for cruelty. It is noteworthy that this was \\nnot the 'sole or decisive' evidence: the Court stressed that the child's injuries were non-accidental and D had ample \\nopportunity to cross-examine the only other people who could possibly have caused them. See also MH [2012] \\nEWCA Crim 2725, where the early disclosures of a very young child were inadmissible under the CJA 2003, s. 120, \\nbecause he could not confirm that he had made them, but it was held that they could have been received under s. \\n114(1)(d). In Strotten [2015] EWCA Crim 1101, a young child was unable to confirm in his ABE interviews that he \\nhad been assaulted, but the complaints he had made to close family members (some of which might have been \\nadmissible under the res gestae exception: see F17.50) were held to have been properly admitted under s. \\n114(1)(d). Independent support for the complaint was derived from similar allegations made by an older child.\\nIn Lynch [2007] EWCA Crim 3035, [2008] 1 Cr App R 24 (337), a statement made by a witness following a positive \\nidentification at an identification parade was not sufficiently 'bound up' with the identification to be part of the res \\ngestae (see F17.49), but was admissible under s. 114(1)(d). In Gillooley [2009] EWCA Crim 671, s. 114(1)(d) was \\nemployed to admit the first complaints of sexual abuse made by a young man to his mother and his girlfriend. The \\ncomplaints were made years after the events to which they related, and were inadmissible under s. 120 (see \\nF6.36), but were of clear probative value in relation to establishing the way in which the complaint had emerged. In \\nTaylor [2006] EWCA Crim 260, [2006] 2 Cr App R 14 (222), s. 114(1)(d) was invoked in order to plug the common \\ngap in continuity whereby the name of a suspect is supplied by a witness who knows it only because of having been \\ntold it by another. See also Saunders [2012] EWCA Crim 1185, where s. 114(1)(d) was invoked to admit statements \\nby a witness, B, to two friends that she had seen an offence which in her evidence she had denied having \\nwitnessed. B had told her friends that she was too frightened to tell the whole truth, but the provisions governing \\nfearful witnesses (s. 116(2)(e): see F17.17) were inapplicable because B had testified on the point. The Court of \\nAppeal said that it would be 'curious' if the previous statements could not be used. The note was inadmissible under Relationship with Other Hearsay Exceptions\\ns. 117 (see F17.30) because the defence refused to waive legal privilege in order to allow the solicitor to give oral \\nevidence.\\nF17.39\\nCourts are likely to afford rigorous scrutiny to evidence tendered under s. 114(1)(d) that would have been \\nobjectionable at common law. In Y [2008] EWCA Crim 10, [2008] 1 Cr App R 34 (411), the issue was whether the \\nconfession of a third party implicating an accused was capable of being used in evidence against him under s. \\n114(1)(d), despite a strong common-law rule that the statement could be used only against its maker. The Court of \\nAppeal held that the effect of s. 114(1)(d) was that the evidence was capable of being admitted, there being nothing \\nin s. 118 (which preserves certain common-law rules of admissibility including evidence of confessions and \\nadmissions: see F17.66) to render such evidence inadmissible under s. 114(1)(d). However, the Court also drew \\nattention to the 'rigorous' test to be applied, and the need for particular caution where the prosecution sought to \\nplace reliance on a third party's confession in the absence of supporting evidence against an accused. Y was \\napplied by the Court of Appeal in Amin [2014] EWCA Crim 1924. The issue was whether covert recordings of \\nconversations in prison between two men who were subsequently convicted of the 'honour killing' of V were \\nadmissible under s. 114(1)(d) against D, who had been charged in respect of the disposal of V's body. The \\nconversations also incriminated the makers and were clearly admissible against them. The prosecution could not \\nhave been expected to call them, but there was nothing to prevent D from doing so. The Court considered that the \\nevidence could safely be admitted: the reliability of the statements implicating D was supported by the link to the \\nconfessions of the murderers, who had not realised they were being overheard, nor was there any separate reason \\nwhy they might have harboured any hostility towards A, a family member of one of them, that might render the \\nstatements about him unreliable. The statements also formed part of a series of recordings of conversations \\nincluding two with D himself when he visited the murderers in prison, and the implication as to D's involvement was \\nconsistent throughout. In Trought [2017] EWCA Crim 1701, the case for the prosecution included evidence of a \\nconfession by W, a party to the drugs conspiracy with which D was charged, and this, together with other evidence, \\nwas used to show that W was working off a debt to D by acting as his courier for the drugs. W had been sentenced \\nfor his part in the conspiracy and was a serving prisoner at the time of D's trial. The argument on appeal was that \\nthe judge had given insufficient attention to the possibility of W being called as a witness for the prosecution. It was \\nheld that the judge had paid due regard to the relevant considerations. There was evidence of ongoing contact \\nbetween D and W, and that D was endeavouring to buy W's silence by promises of financial assistance for W's \\nfamily. W was also further indebted to D, having lost the drugs he was delivering when he was arrested. The \\nprosecution's view was that there was no realistic prospect of W giving a statement for the prosecution or of giving \\nevidence, and there had been no suggestion by the defence at the trial that the prosecution should follow this \\ncourse of action. W's confession was correctly admitted.\\nWhere the maker of the statement is available for cross-examination this will tell in favour of admitting the hearsay, \\neven if the person is also a co-accused. In Burns [2015] EWCA Crim 2542, D1's co-accused, D2, made a number \\nof hearsay statements to friends in which he narrated D1's leading role in a murder while minimising his own. The \\nversion of events D2 gave in evidence was less explicit about D1's role, but D2's availability to be cross-examined \\nwas a matter to which the Court of Appeal attached 'considerable importance' in holding that the hearsay \\nstatements had been properly admitted in evidence against D1, together with other considerations including the \\nmanner in which the hearsay accounts were supported by other evidence.\\nThe statement under caution of one co-accused, incriminating another, may similarly be considered for admission \\nunder s. 114(1)(d) (B [2008] EWCA Crim 365), but the provision clearly does not make police interviews routinely \\nadmissible in the case of persons other than the interviewee, and McLean [2007] EWCA Crim 219, [2008] 1 Cr App \\nR 11 (155) was said in Y not to be authority to the contrary. A warning should be given where a statement in \\ninterview by one co-accused is admitted against the other, both because the maker had his or her own interest to \\nserve and because the accused against whom the statement was made was not present and was not in a position \\nto challenge it at the time (Crown Court Compendium, ch. 14-15). In Nguyen [2020] EWCA Crim 140, [2020] 2 Cr \\nApp R 19 (286), the interview of D2 as evidence against D1 was admitted. The Court of Appeal rejected an \\nargument that the application should have been made at the outset of the trial. The Court in Y had expressly Relationship with Other Hearsay Exceptions\\nrecognised that where the maker of the statement gave evidence and was cross-examined about it, an application \\nmight subsequently be made to admit the previous statement under s. 114(1)(d) even though it was already before \\nthe jury. D2 had substantially changed his account when giving evidence, retracting statements at interview that \\nwould have been admissible against D1 had D2 instead affirmed them. The Court noted that the correct time to \\nmake the application would have been at the end of the prosecution's cross-examination of D2, or at the very least \\nthe prosecution should have warned D1's counsel at that stage that an application was likely to be made. Evidence \\nmay have been too readily admissible in Seton [2010] EWCA Crim 450, where the defence was that the murder \\nwith which D was charged was committed by P, and the statement of P in a recorded telephone call made from \\nprison in which he expressed his indignation at the assertion was admitted in rebuttal. The Court of Appeal \\naccepted that no attempt had been made to procure the attendance of P, but concluded that, in the light of P's \\nrefusal to co-operate with the authorities, it would have been a 'fruitless exercise'. D's assertion against P was \\nmade very late in the day, and the Court's inference that this was a deliberate ploy may have coloured the decision. \\nIn Seton v UK [2016] ECHR 318, the ECtHR accepted that the evidence of P did not render the trial of D unfair. \\nHowever the Court drew attention to the fact that it could not be said that all reasonable efforts had been made to \\nsecure the attendance of P. In Sliogeris [2015] EWCA Crim 22, the trial judge made an error when considering the \\nadmissibility of an out-of-court statement made by co-accused D2, blaming co-accused D1 for the murder of V. The \\nstatement was sought to be put in evidence by co-accused D3, whose defence was that D1 alone had killed V. D2, \\nwho did not testify, had made the statement to witness M, and the judge, in applying the criteria in s. 114(2), ruled \\non the basis that the maker of the statement was M rather than D2. However, as the judge had also taken account \\nof matters relevant to the credibility of the statement itself, his error did not affect the admissibility of the statement.\\nThe reach of s. 114(1)(d) does not extend to the evidence of a witness who wishes to remain anonymous. In Ford \\n[2010] EWCA Crim 2250, a note written by such a witness regarding the registration number of a getaway car was \\nheld inadmissible. The CAJA 2009, ss. 86 to 90 (see D14.88 et seq.), provide the sole route to admissibility for \\nanonymous witnesses, and that legislation makes no provision for the admissibility of hearsay. In Hussain [2019] \\nEWCA Crim 2416, it was held that the trial judge had rightly excluded evidence that a person giving a false name \\nand address had telephoned police with information that if true might have assisted the defence. The jury would \\nhave had no way of assessing the reliability of such a statement under the CJA 2003, s. 114(1)(d), and its \\nadmission would have undermined the integrity of the trial.\\nIn L [2008] EWCA Crim 973, [2009] 1 WLR 626, the prosecution relied on the out-of-court statement of D's wife, \\nwho declined to give evidence on charges against him which included rape of their 20-year-old daughter (as to \\nwhich she was not compellable). The Court of Appeal held that there was no absolute rule prohibiting the use of s. \\n114(1)(d), despite the 'paradox' that the evidence that she did not wish to give, and was legally excused from giving, \\nwas placed before the jury. The public interest was served by admitting the evidence, taking account of the course \\nof conduct by D which included offences against the same daughter as a child. See also Horsnell [2012] EWCA \\nCrim 227.\\nF17.40\\nSection 114(1)(d) is most likely to be resorted to where evidence is otherwise unlikely to be admissible, but may \\nalso provide an alternative argument where it is not clearly so: see Isichei [2006] EWCA Crim 1815 (see F16.20) \\nand Xhabri [2005] EWCA Crim 3135, [2006] 1 All ER 776, where some of the statements by the alleged victim of \\nabduction were also capable of being received under other exceptions (e.g., the extended provision for the \\nreception of evidence of recent complaint in s. 120: see F6.32). In the case of first-hand hearsay statements, \\nhowever, the alternative of admitting the evidence under s. 114(1)(d) was accepted by the court. In Bains [2010] \\nEWCA Crim 873, the messages received via mobile telephones in connection with alleged drug dealing were held \\nto be hearsay by application of the decision in Leonard [2009] EWCA Crim 1251 (see F16.19), though the point was \\nclearly regarded by the Court of Appeal as arguable. In recognising that it was in the interests of justice to admit the \\nmessages, the Court noted that, where messages of the kind that drug dealers might be expected to send or \\nreceive are in the hands of the prosecution, it is unrealistic to expect the prosecution to call the senders of the \\nmessages to prove that what they said was true. See also Twist [2011] EWCA Crim 1143, [2011] 3 All ER 1055 at \\nF16.17. The fact that a statement has been admitted for one purpose under a different hearsay exception does not Relationship with Other Hearsay Exceptions\\nnecessarily entail that s. 114(1)(d) can be invoked to enable a different use. In Thomasson [2021] EWCA Crim 114, \\nan E-Fit image was admitted by agreement for the purpose of cross-examination of the witness at whose direction it \\nhad been made, and whose later recognition of D from a photograph was said to be untrustworthy, but it was held \\nnot to be in the interests of justice under s. 114(1)(d) for the defence to use it for the further purpose of inviting the \\ninvestigating officers to confirm that they had not at the time considered it a possible likeness of D.\\nIn the unusual case of Turner [2012] EWCA Crim 1786, [2013] 1 Cr App R 25 (327), it was held that s. 114(1)(d) \\nmight have been used to admit the evidence of a witness who was unable to testify to matters of a sexual nature \\nowing to acute embarrassment. However, those matters were not in dispute (the issues at trial being consent and \\nher age when the acts took place) and the trial judge was able to circumvent the difficulty by allowing the matters on \\nwhich the witness was stuck to be put to her and adopted from her previous statement, thus leaving her available \\nfor cross-examination in a way that s. 114(1)(d) would not have done.\\n\"]\n",

Thus, for example, registers of baptisms, marriages and funerals are public \\ndocuments, as are surveys of Crown Lands, and university records may prove the granting of degrees (Collins v \\nCarnegie (1834) 1 A & E 695). Foreign registers may be public documents if the relevant conditions are satisfied \\n(Lyell v Kennedy (1889) 14 App Cas 437; Sturla v Freccia). See also the Evidence (Foreign Dominion and Colonial \\nDocuments) Act 1933, s. 1 of which confers a power to declare that certain foreign registers are public documents.\\nOne reason for the rule is the presumption that entries in such documents made by public officers are to be relied \\nupon (Irish Society v Bishop of Derry (1846) 12 Cl & F 641, per Parke B). However, it is also the case that the rule \\nis based on necessity: were it not for the admissibility of public documents, many facts occurring in the distant past \\nwould be incapable of proof.\\nIn modern times the importance of the common-law rule has been overshadowed by various statutes rendering \\nparticular documents admissible, and (more importantly) by the CJA 2003, s. 117 (see F17.25), under which \\nAdmissibility of Public Documents at Common Law and under the Criminal Justice Act 2003\\nvirtually all of the documents which were receivable under the common-law rule, and many that were not, are \\nadmissible. In West Midlands Probation Board v French [2008] EWHC 2631 (Admin), [2009] 1 WLR 1715, it was \\nheld that, where a prisoner released on licence was charged with breach of conditions, a copy of the licence could \\nbe proved either as a public document under the CJA 2003, s. 118(1)(b), or under s. 117 (see F17.25) or under the \\nDocumentary Evidence Act 1868, s. 2 (see F8.17). It is not clear what hearsay purpose was served by proving the \\nlicence: see F16.18.\\nF17.44\\nPublic Duty The document must have been made in pursuance of what Lord Blackburn termed 'a judicial, or quasi-\\njudicial, duty to inquire' (Sturla v Freccia (1880) 5 App Cas 623, at p. 643). The duty must be imposed by virtue of a \\npublic office: thus, parish registers of baptisms, marriages and burials are public documents, whereas similar \\nrecords compiled by other religious groups such as the Quakers are not (Re Woodward [1913] 1 Ch 392). Older \\nauthority strongly supports the view that the document must be made by the very officer whose duty it is to inquire \\ninto the facts, and who would therefore have been satisfied of the truth of the facts stated (see, e.g., Sturla v \\nFreccia and Daniel v Wilkin (1852) 7 Exch 429). However, in Halpin [1975] QB 907 it was held that the functions of \\ninquirer and recorder could be divided, with the result that the statutory returns of a company kept in the Companies \\nRegister were admissible where it appeared that the officer making the return had a duty to inquire, and the \\nRegistrar of Companies had the duty to record the results of the inquiry. Geoffrey Lane LJ said (at p. 915): 'The \\ncommon law should move with the times and should recognise the fact that the official charged with recording \\nmatters of public import can no longer in this highly complicated world … have personal knowledge of their \\naccuracy'. The decision has been criticised on the grounds that the House of Lords in Myers v DPP [1965] AC 1001 \\nprohibited further judicial extension of the rules admitting hearsay evidence, but, whatever the merits of the \\ncriticism, the evidence would now be admissible under the CJA 2003, s. 117 (see F17.25).\\nWhere a record is kept by a public officer not for the benefit of others, but simply for personal use as a check, it is \\nnot a public document (Merrick v Wakley (1838) 8 A & E 170).\\nF17.45\\nPublic Matter The subject-matter of the document need not concern the public as a whole. In Sturla v Freccia \\n(1880) 5 App Cas 623, Lord Blackburn said (at p. 643):\\nI do not think that 'public' … is to be taken in the sense of meaning the whole world. I think an entry in the \\nbooks of a manor is public in the sense that it concerns all the people interested in the manor. And an entry \\nprobably in a corporation book concerning a corporate matter, or something in which all the corporation is \\nconcerned, would be 'public' within that sense.\\nWhether a document deals with a matter of public concern inevitably raises a question of degree, and entries in a \\ncorporation's book are not necessarily admissible, despite Lord Blackburn's dictum (see, e.g., Hill v Manchester & \\nSalford Waterworks Co. (1833) 5 B & Ad 866). Documents which do not comply with this condition are likely to be \\nadmissible under the CJA 1988, s. 24.\\nF17.46\\nPublic Reference Documents which are not maintained for the use of such members of the public as may need to \\nrefer to them are not admissible under this exception. In Lilley v Pettit [1946] KB 401, D was prosecuted for falsely \\nstating that her husband was the father of her child. It was held that regimental records showing that the husband \\nwas a prisoner of war abroad when the child was conceived were inadmissible because they were not intended for \\nthe use of the public. See also Ioannou v Demetriou [1952] AC 84.\\nFor the same reason, a record which is maintained for a temporary purpose cannot be received under this \\nexception (Mercer v Denne [1905] 2 Ch 538; Heyne v Fischel & Co. (1913) 30 TLR 190), although there would be \\nno such objection to its reception in evidence under the CJA 2003, s. 117.Admissibility of Public Documents at Common Law and under the Criminal Justice Act 2003\\nF17.47\\nOther Registers etc. Admissible by Statute Some entries in registers are admissible as public documents (see \\nF17.42). In many cases, however, statute makes express provision for the admissibility of particular registers. \\nDetailed consideration of such provisions is beyond the scope of this work.\\nNote the provisions of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, s. 34. See also the Non-Parochial Registers Act \\n1840, s. 6, under which certain records and registers deposited in the General Register Office in accordance with \\nthat Act are admissible, and the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1858.\\nAn entry in a register showing that a person has died is admissible evidence of the fact and date of death, but not of \\nthe cause of death (Bird v Keep [1918] 2 KB 692). Where a birth certificate is relied upon to prove some fact \\ncontained in it, the evidence may be of no use unless it can be proved that the person named in it is the same \\nindividual with whom the court is concerned. This is difficult to establish without breaking the hearsay rule, for the \\nperson named cannot give evidence of that fact. A person who was present at the birth may establish identity \\n(Weaver (1873) LR 2 CCR 85), though such proof may be hard to come by. It is not surprising that, in some cases, \\nhearsay evidence has been admitted: see, e.g., Bellis (1911) 6 Cr App R 283, in which the court admitted evidence \\nof inquiries made about the girl whose age was in issue, which had led the inquirer to be satisfied as to her identity.\\n\"]\n",

Andrews clarified the law by approving the \\nmodern test for admissibility adopted by the Privy Council in Ratten v The Queen [1972] AC 378, an approach \\napproved in Mills v The Queen [1995] 3 All ER 865.\\nIn many of the older authorities, the exception was invoked in order to admit statements made by the deceased \\nidentifying the attacker in a prosecution for murder or manslaughter. Such statements now fall within the CJA 2003, \\ns. 116 (see F17.8), so there is no need to incur the additional burden of proving that the utterance was excited. \\nHowever the res gestae exception has enjoyed a renaissance in cases of violent assault where the complainant is \\nreluctant to testify, raising concerns for the implications in relation to fair trial (see further F17.55).\\nF17.51\\nIn Ratten v The Queen, Lord Wilberforce described the rule under which spontaneous statements are admitted in \\nthe following way (at pp. 389–90):\\nThe test should be not the uncertain one, whether the making of the statement should be regarded as part of \\nthe event or transaction. This may often be difficult to show. But if the drama, leading up to the climax, has \\ncommenced and assumed such intensity and pressure that the utterance can safely be regarded as a true \\nreflection of what was unrolling or actually happening, it ought to be received.\\nF17.52\\nIn Andrews, D was charged with the murder by stabbing of V, who was attacked by two men in his own home. \\nWithin minutes neighbours called the police, who arrived promptly, whereupon V made a statement identifying his \\nattackers. The trial judge admitted the statement and, in a ruling regarded as 'impeccable' both by the Court of \\nAppeal and the House of Lords, he held that there was no possibility in the circumstances of concoction or \\nfabrication of the identification, and that the injuries sustained by V were of such a nature as to drive out any \\npossibility of his being actuated by malice. He also took account of the fact that V correctly identified the other \\nattacker as O, who had subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Lord Ackner summarised the position which \\nconfronts a trial judge when faced in a criminal case with an application under the res gestae doctrine to admit \\nevidence of statements, with a view to establishing the truth of some fact thus narrated. He said (at pp. 300–1):\\n 1.     The primary question which the judge must ask himself is — can the possibility of concoction or distortion \\nbe disregarded?\\n 2.     To answer that question the judge must first consider the circumstances in which the particular statement \\nwas made, in order to satisfy himself that the event was so unusual or startling or dramatic as to dominate \\nthe thoughts of the victim, so that his utterance was an instinctive reaction to that event, thus giving no real \\nopportunity for reasoned reflection. In such a situation the judge would be entitled to conclude that the \\ninvolvement or the pressure of the event would exclude the possibility of concoction or distortion, providing \\nthat the statement was made in conditions of approximate but not exact contemporaneity.\\nRes Gestae Statements in Response to Emotionally Overpowering Events\\n 3.     In order for the statement to be sufficiently 'spontaneous' it must be so closely associated with the event \\nwhich has excited the statement, that it can be fairly stated that the mind of the declarant was still \\ndominated by the event. Thus the judge must be satisfied that the event which provided the trigger \\nmechanism for the statement, was still operative. The fact that the statement was made in answer to a \\nquestion is but one factor to consider under this heading.\\n 4.     Quite apart from the time factor, there may be special features in the case, which relate to the possibility \\nof concoction or distortion. In the instant appeal the defence relied on evidence to support the contention \\nthat the deceased had a motive of his own to fabricate or concoct, namely, a malice which resided in him \\nagainst O'Neill and the appellant because, so he believed, O'Neill had attacked and damaged his house \\nand was accompanied by the appellant, who ran away on a previous occasion. The judge must be satisfied \\nthat the circumstances were such that having regard to the special feature of malice, there was no \\npossibility of any concoction or distortion to the advantage of the maker or the disadvantage of the \\naccused.\\n 5.     As to the possibility of error in the facts narrated in the statement, if only the ordinary fallibility of human \\nrecollection is relied upon, this goes to the weight to be attached to and not the admissibility of the \\nstatement and is therefore a matter for the jury. However, here again there may be special features that \\nmay give rise to the possibility of error. In the instant case there was evidence that the deceased had drunk \\nto excess, well over double the permitted limit for driving a motor car. Another example would be where the \\nidentification was made in circumstances of particular difficulty or where the declarant suffered from \\ndefective eyesight. In such circumstances the trial judge must consider whether he can exclude the \\npossibility of error.\\nSome of the difficulties surrounding identification referred to by Lord Ackner arose and were considered in Turnbull \\n(1984) 80 Cr App R 104 (see F17.57).\\nIt appears from Brown (Nico) [2019] EWCA Crim 1143, [2019] 2 Cr App R 25 (271) that an admissible res gestae \\nstatement may be derived from the accounts of two eye-witnesses, one (who later gave evidence) making an \\nemergency call having witnessed a stabbing, in which she read a car registration number written down by the other \\n(who was unable to be traced after the incident). Both witnesses were reacting spontaneously to the same shocking \\nevent.\\nF17.53\\nPossibility of Error Prior to the decision in Andrews, it had been held, in Nye (1977) 66 Cr App R 252, that the \\npossibility of error by the maker of the statement was an 'additional factor to be taken into consideration' when \\ndetermining admissibility. It is now clear from the extract from the speech of Lord Ackner in Andrews set out above, \\nthat the risk of error bears on the question of admissibility only in cases having 'special features', e.g., an \\nidentification in difficult circumstances or by a person with defective eyesight, or by someone who had been \\ndrinking. In Nye, one L was driving his car when it was struck from behind by another vehicle in which the accused, \\nD1 and D2, were travelling. One of the accused then got out and punched L in the face, while the other tried to put \\na stop to the assault. Shortly afterwards, when the police arrived, L spontaneously identified D2 as the man who \\nhad hit him. It was argued that L might have made a mistake as to which of the accused had attacked him. On \\nthese facts the Court of Appeal considered that there was no chance of an error, stressing in particular that: \\n'anyone who has been assaulted usually has good reason for remembering what his assailant's face looks like'. It is \\ntherefore unlikely that, applying the test in Andrews, special circumstances such as the great stress immediately \\nafter a motor accident, will be held to affect the admissibility of evidence. The fact that the maker of the statement \\nhad been drinking, though capable of being a 'special feature', does not necessarily lead to exclusion. In Andrews \\nthe deceased had 'drunk to excess', and in Edwards [1992] Crim LR 576, the Divisional Court held that a \\nspontaneous allegation of theft of a wallet made against D by A, who was drunk, was admissible.\\nThe possibility of error or concoction on the part of the witness recounting the statement, as opposed to the maker \\nof the statement, is not part of the test for admissibility, though the discretion to exclude such evidence (using the \\nPACE 1984, s. 78) could be brought to bear in an appropriate case (Saunders [2012] EWCA Crim 1185).Res Gestae Statements in Response to Emotionally Overpowering Events\\nF17.54\\nOffence Must Generate Statement The event which generates the statement admitted under the rule stated \\nabove must be the commission of the offence in question. This is implicit in both Ratten v The Queen and Andrews, \\nand is expressly stated by Lord Normand in Teper v The Queen [1952] AC 480, who said (at p. 488): 'for \\nidentification purposes in a criminal trial the event with which the words sought to be proved must be so connected \\nas to form part of the res gestae, is the commission of the crime itself, the throwing of the stone, the striking of the \\nblow, the setting fire to the building or whatever the criminal act might be'. A res gestae statement will typically have \\nbeen made by the victim of the offence, or a bystander, but may also, if the conditions of admissibility are satisfied, \\nbe made by the accused (Glover [1991] Crim LR 48).\\nF17.55\\nStatement Not to be Used as Substitute for Available Witness In Andrews [1987] AC 281, Lord Ackner \\nobserved (at p. 302):\\nI would, however, strongly deprecate any attempt in criminal prosecutions to use the doctrine as a device to \\navoid calling, where he is available, the maker of the statement. Thus to deprive the defence of the opportunity \\nto cross-examine him, would not be consistent with the fundamental duty of the prosecution to place all the \\nrelevant material facts before the court, so as to ensure that justice is done.\\nIn A-G's Ref (No. 1 of 2003) [2003] EWCA Crim 1286, [2003] 2 Cr App R 29 (453), the Court observed that \\nAndrews was not authority for the proposition that the res gestae exception was to be disapplied if better evidence \\nwas available. In that case, the prosecution had used the exception, not as a device to avoid calling the victim of an \\nassault to give evidence against the accused, her son, but because she had later made a formal statement claiming \\nto have sustained the injuries accidentally, which the prosecution believed to be untrue. Nevertheless it was held \\nthat the trial judge's decision to exclude the res gestae statement could be supported on the basis that it was unfair \\nto admit it when it could not be the subject of cross-examination (applying the PACE 1984, s. 78). The prosecution \\nshould have been prepared to tender the mother as a witness: it was not an adequate response that the defence \\nmight have called her. It does not follow from this rule that the res gestae exception has no application where the \\nwitness gives evidence. In Shickle (30 July 1997 unreported), D was charged with murder and evidence was given \\nby her teenage son, A, who had witnessed the event. It was held that A's evidence was properly supplemented by \\nspontaneous statements he made at the time, such as 'Mummy's putting needles in the old boy' and 'Hurry up, \\nwe've got to stop Mummy'. The Court could find no reason of principle why the evidence should be withheld when \\nthe declarant is available. It was further held that the statement, when admitted, goes not only to the truth of the \\nmatter but to the consistency of the maker, on the basis that the greater purpose includes the lesser. It is submitted \\nthat the Court's approach is entirely correct.\\nF17.56\\nRes gestae and Domestic Abuse Cases A-G's Ref (No. 1 of 2003) [2003] EWCA Crim 1286, [2003] 2 Cr App R \\n29 (453) was considered in Barnaby v DPP [2015] EWHC 232 (Admin). Statements made by the complainant \\nduring phone calls to the emergency services in which she said of D, her boyfriend, 'I'm so scared because he's just \\nstrangled me' were held admissible as part of the res gestae, together with statements made some six minutes later \\nin conversation with the police officers who responded to the call and who testified to her fear and their observation \\nof her recent injuries. The complainant was available to give evidence at trial, but was not called. Rejecting a \\nsubmission that the statements should have been tendered under the CJA 2003, s. 114(1)(d) (see F17.34), so as to \\nallow for a proper consideration, inter alia, of the reliability of the complainant and the reasons for not calling her, \\nthe Divisional Court noted that this was a case where the prosecution were aware from the outset that the \\ncomplainant was afraid of further violence from D. Fulford LJ commented: 'this was not a situation in which the \\nprosecution was seeking to resort to unfair tactics in order to avoid introducing evidence that was potentially \\ninconsistent with the case against the defendant, or because it simply anticipated that there was a risk the witness \\nmight give an untruthful account'. The proper vehicle to vindicate the defence concerns would have been an \\napplication at trial to exclude the evidence under the PACE 1984, s. 78, but no such application was made. A \\nsimilar conclusion was reached in Ibrahim v CPS [2016] EWHC 1750 (Admin), where the rule laid down in A-G's Res Gestae Statements in Response to Emotionally Overpowering Events\\nRef (No. 1 of 2003) was said to be inapplicable to the situation where a victim of domestic violence is in fear of a \\nrisk of harm following co-operation with the police. In that case the evidence was received under the res gestae, \\nalthough the specific 'fear' exception in the CJA 2003, s. 116 (see F17.17), might also have been deployed. Under \\nthat exception, the court is bound to consider whether special measures might have been adopted that would have \\nenabled the fearful witness to come to court. In Morgan v DPP [2016] EWHC 3414 (Admin), the question of special \\nmeasures was held not to be of great significance where the application is made under the res gestae exception. In \\nthat case V, the alleged victim of domestic violence, was unwilling to attend the trial to give evidence, on the ground \\nthat she did not wish to relive the events in issue. The evidence admitted consisted of V's 999 call when reporting \\nthe incident, and the footage from the bodycam of the officer who attended shortly thereafter, which included V's \\naccount of what had happened. The Divisional Court also observed that special measures would not have \\ncountered V's fear of reliving the experience. In Barnaby v DPP, Ibrahim v CPS and Morgan v DPP the courts can \\nbe seen to be endorsing the proposition that the prosecutor was entitled to have appropriate regard for the well-\\nbeing of a witness in the domestic violence context. But in cases where the complainant fails to testify through fear, \\nit is important that the res gestae exception does not provide a way round the considerations laid down in s. \\n116(2)(e) (see F17.17), and the concern expressed in Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349 about the \\nimportance of ensuring that witnesses attend court wherever possible. Where there are other reasons for the \\nwitness's reluctance, such as a desire to reconcile with the accused, there may be an equally difficult balance to be \\nstruck between respecting the complainant's decision and the public interest in basing a prosecution on earlier res \\ngestae statements. In Wills v CPS [2016] EWHC 3779 (Admin), where the complainant unexpectedly failed to turn \\nup to give evidence, it was said to be inappropriate for the magistrates to proceed to a consideration of res gestae \\nwithout first determining the reasons for non-attendance. If fear was involved, consideration could be given to \\nmeans for dispelling it. Whether the witness was fearful or not, the reasons for non-attendance were relevant to the \\nconsideration of whether the court should exercise its discretion under s. 78 of the PACE 1984 to receive the \\nevidence. In Speed [2017] EWCA Crim 1908 and in McGuinness v Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service \\n[2017] NICA 30 the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal for Northern Ireland stressed that the criteria for \\napplying the 'interests of justice' exception in s. 114(1)(d) (see F17.34) are likely to be of help when exercising the \\ndiscretion in cases involving res gestae statements. It should therefore be possible to ensure that the common-law \\nres gestae exception does not produce results that appear to be at odds with either the provisions for fearful \\nwitnesses (which apply similar criteria) or those for the interests of justice exception.\\nF17.57\\nIllustrations of Application of the Rule In Turnbull (1984) 80 Cr App R 104, a man who had been mortally \\nwounded staggered into a public house. In the minutes before an ambulance arrived, and in the ambulance on the \\nway to hospital, various witnesses thought that they heard the victim state, in answer to the question who had \\nstabbed him, that it was 'Ronnie Tommo'. The deceased had a strong Scottish accent and the prosecution case \\nwas that he in fact said 'Turnbull'. The statements were admitted, and it was held to be irrelevant that the deceased \\nwent on to mutter other words which the witnesses were unable to understand. In O'Shea (24 July 1986 \\nunreported), which was considered in Andrews [1987] AC 281, the elderly occupier of a second-floor flat into which \\nD was trying to break, slipped while trying to escape through a window and sustained injuries which eventually \\nresulted in his death. He was found lying where he had fallen an hour or so after the incident, and the statement \\nwhich he then made, in which he stated the reason for his injuries, was admitted in evidence. See also Ibrahim v \\nCPS [2016] EWHC 1750 (Admin) and Morgan v DPP [2016] EWHC 3414 (Admin) (see F17.56), in which V's \\ninjuries were sustained some 90 minutes (Ibrahim) and an hour (Morgan) before the emergency services were \\nsummoned, and the evidence was admitted. By contrast, in Newport [1998] Crim LR 581, a telephone call made by \\nD's wife 20 minutes before he inflicted fatal injuries on her, in which she arranged to take sanctuary in a friend's \\nhouse if she had to flee in a hurry, was held to have been wrongly admitted. On the facts there was an insufficient \\nconnection between the incident and the wife's request: the call was not a spontaneous and unconsidered reaction \\nto an immediately impending emergency.\\nThe theory behind the res gestae rule, that spontaneity is some guarantee against concoction, 'does not sit well' \\nwith the case where the utterance is that of a child who is too young to be aware of the significance of the events \\nnarrated. In QD [2019] NICA 7, the speaker was a child of three who narrated an act of masturbation by the \\naccused. Far from being startled by events, the child was happily playing at the time, and there was no evidence Res Gestae Statements in Response to Emotionally Overpowering Events\\nthat his thoughts were 'dominated' by events in the required sense. (The statement was admitted instead under the \\n'interests of justice' exception: see F17.34).\\nF17.58\\nIn Tobi v Nicholas [1988] RTR 343, a collision occurred between a car and a stationary motor coach. Some 20 \\nminutes later the driver of the coach, who had summoned the police, identified D as the driver of the car involved. \\nThe coach driver was not called to give evidence at the trial, and the Divisional Court held, applying Andrews [1987] \\nAC 281, that there were three reasons why his statement should not have been admitted as part of the res gestae:\\n (1)     The event which had occurred was not so unusual or dramatic as to dominate the thoughts of the victim. \\n'Of course anybody whose vehicle has been damaged is annoyed about it, but there is a world of \\ndifference between such an unfortunately commonplace situation and the thoughts of somebody who has \\nbeen assaulted and stabbed' (per Glidewell LJ, at p. 356).\\n (2)     The statement was not sufficiently contemporaneous with the event.\\n (3)     The res gestae doctrine should not be used as a device to avoid calling the maker of the statement \\nwhere available, as the coach driver was, to give evidence.\\nF17.59\\nUse of Statement Itself to Determine Admissibility In Ratten v The Queen [1972] AC 378, Lord Wilberforce said \\n(at p. 391) that in principle it would not be right for the involvement of the speaker in the pressure of the drama \\nsurrounding the event to be proved only by the statement itself, 'otherwise the statement would be lifting itself into \\nthe area of admissibility'. However, it was difficult to imagine a case where there was no other evidence to connect \\nthe speaker to the event, and it would not be wrong in principle for the judge to take the statement into account, \\ntogether with other things, in reaching a decision.\\nF17.60\\nDirection to Jury In Andrews [1987] AC 281, Lord Ackner said that where a 'spontaneous' statement has been \\nadmitted in evidence as part of the res gestae, the judge must make it clear to the jury:\\n (a)     that it is for them to decide what was said and to be sure that the witnesses were not mistaken in what \\nthey believed had been said to them;\\n (b)     that 'they must be satisfied that the declarant did not concoct or distort to his advantage or to the \\ndisadvantage of the accused the statement relied upon and where there is material to raise the issue, that \\nhe was not activated by any malice or ill-will' (at p. 302);\\n (c)     where there are special features that bear on the possibility of mistake, then the jury's attention must be \\ninvited to those matters.\\nIn Mills v The Queen [1995] 3 All ER 865, the Privy Council rejected an argument that a specific direction must \\nalways be given as to the risk of mistaken identification by a dying man in a res gestae statement. The jury in that \\ncase had been adequately directed about the risks of mistaken identification in relation to the evidence of other \\nwitnesses, and fairness did not require a repetition.\\n\"]\n",

Although at first sight such an admission may appear to be a confession, \\nand thus to be governed by the rules of admissibility in the PACE 1984, s. 76 (see F18), it is submitted that this is \\nnot the case, for the section applies only to a confession made 'by an accused person', and, by s. 82(1), \\n'confession' includes any statement adverse to 'the person who made it'. It would seem to follow that vicarious \\nadmissions continue to be governed by common-law principles.\\nA statement made by an agent is admissible against the accused only where it is shown that the statement was \\nmade within the scope of the agent's authority. Agency may be inferred from the circumstances: thus, in Turner \\n(1975) 61 Cr App R 67, it was held that it is permissible to infer from the fact that a barrister makes an admission in \\ncourt on behalf of and in the presence of his or her client, that the barrister was authorised to make it. The strength \\nof the inference depends on the circumstances, however, and in Evans [1981] Crim LR 699, it was held that agency \\nwas not to be inferred simply from the fact that the admission was made by D's solicitor's clerk.\\nThe strict application of the rule of admissibility may work injustice where there is an issue as to whether the \\naccused intended to make the admission put forward, as in Turner where counsel later gave evidence that he had \\nexceeded his authority in doing so. The discretion available to the court using the PACE 1984, s. 78 should be \\nconsidered in such cases. The completion by advocates of pre-trial documentation intended to assist in case \\nmanagement raises particularly sensitive issues. In R (Firth) v Epping Justices [2011] EWHC 388 (Admin), [2011] 1 \\nCr App R 32 (395), the strict rule was applied in pre-trial proceedings to a statement made in what was then a Case \\nProgression Form. As a consequence of Firth, defence advocates became cautious about providing information for \\ncase management purposes which might then be used as an admission, or in cross-examination of the client. This \\nworked against the 'cards on the table' approach on which good case management is based. In Newell [2012] \\nEWCA Crim 650, [2012] 1 WLR 3142, the Court of Appeal, taking account of guidance issued to prosecutors \\nfollowing Firth, held that an advocate completing a PCMH form should be free to help the court with the \\nmanagement of the case by setting out relevant information without the risk of that information being used as a \\nstatement admissible against the accused. Provided therefore that the case is conducted in accordance with the \\nletter and spirit of the CrimPR, such information should in the exercise of the court's discretion under s. 78 not be \\nadmitted as a statement that can be used against an accused. Only very rarely would it be appropriate not to \\nexercise the discretion. The same rule applies in summary proceedings, except where the information is specifically \\nprovided under the part of the relevant documentation relating expressly to admissions or to the acknowledgement \\nthat certain matters are not in issue; these will continue to be admissible at trial. Newell was applied in Valiati [2018] \\nEWHC 2908 (Admin), [2019] 1 Cr App R 17 (216), in which magistrates had wrongly relied on information supplied \\nby the defence in a PET form as though it were evidence in the case. The information might have been presented \\nas an admission by the defence, in reliance on the CJA 2003, s. 118, but this course of action should be adopted \\nonly where the defence have not acted in accordance with the letter and spirit of the CrimPR, typically by seeking to \\nambush the prosecution with a defence which has not been indicated in the PET.\\nF17.68\\nAdmissions by Agents and Referees\\nEvidence of agency must, of course, be admissible in its own right. In Evans, statements made by the solicitor's \\nclerk indicating that he was acting with D's authority were inadmissible to prove agency, being hearsay.

Any rule of law under which in criminal proceedings a statement made by a party to a common enterprise is \\nadmissible against another party to the enterprise as evidence of any matter stated.\\nF17.71\\nScope of the Rule The rule that the acts and statements of one party to a common purpose may be evidence \\nagainst another is particularly associated with charges of conspiracy. However, it is not confined to such cases, and \\napplies to other offences where complicity is alleged. Thus, in Jessop (1877) 16 Cox CC 204, for example, D was \\ncharged with the murder of V, with whom he had entered into a suicide pact to die by taking poison. The plan \\nmiscarried and D survived. Field J held that evidence of the purchase of poison by V, being an act done in \\nfurtherance of the common purpose, was admissible against D. Another illustration is Jones (Brian) [1997] 2 Cr App \\nR 119, in which it was held that the rule applied to a joint enterprise to evade the prohibition on the importation of \\ndrugs, despite the fact that no charge of conspiracy was brought.\\nIn A Ltd, X and Y [2016] EWCA Crim 1469, [2017] 1 Cr App R 1 (1), the Court of Appeal cautioned against \\nconfusing the 'identification' principle (which is used to identify the directing mind and will of a corporate body: see \\nA6.2) with the rules governing the admissibility of acts and declarations made by one co-conspirator in the absence \\nof another. BK was a director of A Ltd who was not prosecuted because he was beyond the jurisdiction of the court. \\nEvidence of his guilty acts and state of mind, however, clearly fell within the identification principle for the purposes \\nof a prosecution of the company, and in that regard reference could be made to BK's diaries and notebook entries \\nto prove his, and therefore the company's, state of mind. (Such documents would not have been admissible against \\nother conspirators if tendered as hearsay under s. 118 as records of one conspirator for his or her own \\nconvenience, or forming narratives of past acts, are outwith the rule: see F17.74.) A Ltd, X and Y was applied in \\nAlstom Network Ltd [2019] EWCA Crim 1318, [2019] 2 Cr App R 34 (417).\\nF17.72\\nThe limits of the doctrine were considered in Gray [1995] 2 Cr App R 100. D and others were each convicted of \\noffences relating to insider dealing. Although there was alleged to be a 'network' between them for the passing of \\ninformation, each allegation related only to an offence committed by one of them alone. The prosecution case \\nconsisted mainly of telephone conversations between the defendants, and the judge told the jury that a statement \\nmade in the course of such a conversation, though a particular defendant was not party to it, could nevertheless be \\nStatements in Furtherance of Common Enterprise\\nevidence against that defendant if there was a joint enterprise between them for the unlawful dissemination of \\n'inside' information and the statement was made in furtherance of that joint enterprise. The Court of Appeal was \\ninclined to the view that this stated the principle too widely: the acts and declarations of a person engaged in a joint \\nenterprise and made in pursuance of that enterprise might be admissible against another, but only where the \\nevidence shows the complicity of that other in a common offence or series of offences. As none of the offences was \\nalleged to have been committed jointly, the rule did not apply. If, contrary to that view, the principle could be stated \\nin the wider form, the prosecution would have to make clear the limits of the alleged agreement in pursuit of which \\nthe specific offences were said to have been committed; as this had not been done the appeals were allowed. Thus \\nit appears that the case for a wider principle could still be made. In Murray [1997] 2 Cr App R 136, the Court of \\nAppeal adopted the interpretation of Gray in the 1996 edition of this work (which is the same as that set out above) \\nand added that that case is authority primarily for the proposition that the common-law exception cannot be \\nextended to cases where individual defendants are charged with a number of separate substantive offences and \\nthe terms of a common enterprise are not provided or are ill-defined. An argument, based on dicta in the case, that \\nGray in fact narrows the scope of the common-law exception was rejected. Murray was approved in Williams \\n(Catherine Julia) [2002] EWCA Crim 2208, where the true rule was considered to be that 'the acts and declarations \\nby A in furtherance of a sufficiently defined common design are admissible to prove a substantive offence \\ncommitted alone in pursuance of the same common design, by B'.\\nF17.73\\nThe rule permits the actions and declarations of one party, A, to be used in evidence against the other, B, and is \\nthus an exception to the general rule that B is not to be prejudiced by the acts or statements of another, and an \\nexception to the hearsay rule insofar as it may involve reliance on A's statements as evidence of their truth. In \\nOnyeabor [2009] EWCA Crim 534, the Court of Appeal regarded as non-hearsay a statement by D's accomplice in \\nfurtherance of their joint enterprise, and stated that it was admissible under s. 118(1), rule 7. It is submitted, \\nhowever, that recourse to s. 118 should not be had unless a hearsay exception is required. As an exception to the \\nhearsay rule, the common enterprise rule defies classification, some writers regarding it as appertaining to the res \\ngestae, others as based on implied agency, and others as an independent exception, the justification for which is \\nthat such evidence must be used if the 'secret' crime of conspiracy is ever to be proved at all.\\nIn order for the act or statement of A to be admissible against B, the rule requires:\\n (1)     that the act or statement of A must be in the course and furtherance of the common purpose; and\\n (2)     that independent evidence be adduced of the existence of the conspiracy and the involvement in it of B.\\nF17.74\\nMeaning of Course and Furtherance of Common Purpose In the leading case of Blake (1844) 6 QB 126, D1 \\nand D2 were charged with conspiring to avoid payment of duty on imported goods. D1, in the course of his \\nemployment at the Customs House, certified that the amount of goods imported by D2 as an agent was less than \\nwas in fact the case. D2 then charged his principal duty on the full amount, recording the charge in his own day \\nbook, and split the proceeds with D1. It was held that the entry in D2's day book was admissible against D1, as \\nbeing evidence of something done in the course of the transaction, but that the counterfoil of the cheque by which \\nD1 received his share of the proceeds was not, for it was an act done after the common purpose was effected \\nwhich had nothing to do with the carrying out of the conspiracy. It will be apparent from Blake that it may be difficult \\nto distinguish precisely where a transaction begins and ends, and whether acts are done in furtherance of it or not. \\nA clearer case of inadmissibility owing to the termination of the criminal purpose is that of the confession of one \\nconspirator made after the point of apprehension, which is evidence only against the maker (see, e.g., Walters \\n(1979) 69 Cr App R 115, at p. 120). A more obvious example of a statement which cannot be said to be in \\nfurtherance of any criminal purpose occurred in Steward [1963] Crim LR 697, where one conspirator simply recited \\nto another the various acts of B which had been done in execution of the common purpose, and the statement was \\nheld inadmissible against B. See also Hardy (1794) 24 St Tr 199, in which a similar recital by a conspirator of his \\nown past acts was held not to be in furtherance of the conspiracy.Statements in Furtherance of Common Enterprise\\nF17.75\\nIn Devonport [1996] 1 Cr App R 221, a statement was admitted which may not, in the strict sense, have furthered \\nthe conspiracy. The court was concerned with a document drawn up by D concerning the proposed division of \\nspoils between himself and others involved. This was regarded by Judge J as a document in furtherance of the \\nconspiracy, distinguishing Blake on the ground that the document was not a record of distribution after the \\nconspiracy but an indication of the intended or prospective distribution of the proceeds of the conspiracy when it \\nhas been fulfilled. Even so, as there was no evidence that the document served any purpose other than D's own \\nconvenience, the decision seems to go further than previous authority. So also does Ilyas [1996] Crim LR 810, in \\nwhich a diary was admitted which was a record of the receipt of stolen car parts by some of the parties to the \\nconspiracy. Nothing was made of the argument that the document was a mere record of what had already occurred \\nand not in furtherance of the enterprise. Latham J, however, asserted that it was 'a document created in the course \\nof, or furtherance, of the conspiracy' (emphasis added). This would seem to be a new and alternative ground of \\nadmissibility, as a document such as the diary can be said to be created in the course of a conspiracy without being \\nin any way in furtherance of it. It would seem that the rule is in the course of being broadened by the courts. See \\nalso Reeves [1999] 3 Arch News 2, in which an aide-memoire by one conspirator for his own assistance appears to \\nhave been regarded as potentially admissible against co-conspirators under this exception, and Platten [2006] \\nEWCA Crim 140, where it was said that 'statements made during the conspiracy and as part of the conspiracy, \\nbecause they are part of making the natural arrangements to carry out the conspiracy, will be admissible'. In \\nPlatten, the Court confined the exclusion of statements which are 'mere narrative' to statements made after the \\nconspiracy is concluded. The Court endorsed the rule of thumb adopted by Kennedy LJ in Barham [1997] 2 Cr App \\nR 119 of 'the enterprise in operation'. See also King [2012] EWCA Crim 805 (co-conspirator's description of \\naccused as 'the hired muscle' was intended to keep the confidence of a prospective purchaser of drugs and was \\nproperly admitted).\\nWhere the hearsay statements of co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy implicate an accused, the trial \\njudge must give a careful direction to the jury that the statements cannot be used to provide the link between that \\naccused and the conspiracy (Blake (1993) 97 Cr App R 169).\\nF17.76\\nRequirement of Independent Evidence of Common Purpose In Blake (1844) 6 QB 126, a case involving \\nconspiracy, Patteson J stated the principle to be that 'you must establish the fact of a conspiracy before you can \\nmake the act of one the act of all'. The absence of such independent evidence renders the statement alleged to \\nhave been made in furtherance of the conspiracy inadmissible, and it is not possible for the statement itself to \\nprovide the evidence of the existence of the conspiracy (see Jenkins [2002] EWCA Crim 2475, and commentary by \\nProfessor Sir John Smith). This does not mean that such evidence must be brought forward and accepted before \\nthe act or statement in question can be proved, for, 'from the nature of this charge [conspiracy] the evidence must \\nnecessarily grow up as it proceeds. The acts of the one party must be given in evidence and then the acts of the \\nother, and it may then be shown that those acts fully prove a conspiracy between them' (Murphy (1837) 8 C & P \\n297, per Coleridge J at pp. 302–3). See also Governor of Pentonville Prison, ex parte Osman [1990] 3 All ER 701 in \\nwhich Lloyd LJ said (at p. 316): 'there must always be some evidence other than the hearsay evidence of a fellow \\nconspirator to prove that a particular defendant is party to a conspiracy. Provided there is some other evidence, it \\ndoes not matter in what order the evidence is adduced.' The principle is thus one of conditional admissibility, in that \\nif, after the evidence has been heard, it transpires that there is no independent evidence of common purpose, the \\nact or statement of A will have to be excluded from the case against B (Donat (1985) 82 Cr App R 173). It is \\nsubmitted that there is no difference in practice between this view and that expressed in Whittaker [1914] 3 KB \\n1283, in which it was said that the act or statement of A, though it may be proved as evidence against him, remains \\ninadmissible against B until the necessary foundation is laid. Insofar as there is a difference, it is submitted that the \\ncorrect practice is as stated in Donat.\\nF17.77Statements in Furtherance of Common Enterprise\\nFailure by the prosecution to satisfy the requirement after evidence of a statement has been admitted de bene esse \\nwill require a careful direction to the jury, and may require the discharge of the jury and a retrial if the evidence \\nadmitted was prejudicial. Where evidence is admitted under the rule it is not necessary for the jury to be directed to \\nconvict only if they find evidence\\nagainst B other than the statement of A. The judge must first be satisfied that such evidence exists: if it does, the \\njury are permitted to look at all the evidence in order to decide guilt (Barham [1997] 2 Cr App 119; King [2012] \\nEWCA Crim 805). If, however, there is a danger that the jury will rely on the statement by A as primary evidence of \\nB's involvement, 'sweeping away' the other evidence which has led the judge to admit the statement in the first \\nplace, the judge should direct the jury as to the shortcomings in the evidence of A, including (if such be the case) \\nthe absence of any opportunity to cross-examine A, and the absence of corroborative evidence (Jones (Brian) \\n[1997] 2 Cr App R 119; Williams (Catherine Julia) [2002] EWCA Crim 2208). In a case where there was other \\nevidence to connect the accused with the conspiracy, the Court of Appeal did not consider it fatal that the trial judge \\nhad failed to warn the jury of the need for caution in convicting on evidence of things said or done by others when \\nthe appellant was not present, though it would have been preferable so to warn them (Sofroniou [2009] EWCA Crim \\n1360).\\n\"]\n",

This appears to apply \\nwhether the hearsay in question is tendered under the new statutory exceptions contained in the Act itself, or under \\nthe preserved common-law exceptions, or under other statutory provisions, given that the new rule is negative in \\nform and defines hearsay evidence in the broadest of terms.\\nCriminal Justice Act 2003, s. 121\\n(1)     A hearsay statement is not admissible to prove the fact that an earlier hearsay statement was made unless—\\n (a)     either of the statements is admissible under section 117, 119 or 120,\\n (b)     all parties to the proceedings so agree, or\\n (c)     the court is satisfied that the value of the evidence in question, taking into account how reliable the \\nstatements appear to be, is so high that the interests of justice require the later statement to be admissible \\nfor that purpose.\\n(2)     In this section 'hearsay statement' means a statement, not made in oral evidence, that is relied on as \\nevidence of a matter stated in it.\\nF17.85\\nUnder this provision, multiple hearsay (such as 'A told me that B told him that D shot V') is not admissible even if \\nboth the statement by A and the statement by B fit within one or more of the various exceptions to the hearsay rule \\n(e.g., B's statement is a spontaneous statement made as part of the res gestae, and A's statement is admissible \\nunder s. 116 because A has died since making it). The only exceptions to this principle are where one of the \\nstatements is admissible as a business document (see s. 117 at F17.25) or a previous statement by a witness in \\nthe case, or where the court is so convinced by the value of the evidence that it can invoke the special 'safety valve' \\nin s. 121(1)(c). In Xhabri [2005] EWCA Crim 3135, [2006] 1 All ER 776 (considered at F17.40), the test in s. 121 \\nwas satisfied in relation to a complaint of false imprisonment which was relayed by two friends of the victim to a \\npolice officer. The complainant and the officer (though not the two friends) were available for cross-examination. \\nThe Court of Appeal considered that both s. 121(1)(a) (admissibility under other provisions) and s. 121(1)(c) \\n(admissibility in the interests of justice) were satisfied. In Maher v DPP [2006] EWHC 1271 (Admin), a note which \\nhad been made (and lost) of a car number plate formed the basis of a call to the police in which the number was \\ntransmitted. Evidence of the number was received under s. 121(1)(c) although it was inadmissible as a business \\nrecord under s. 117 (see F17.27) on the grounds of reliability. This appears to treat s. 121(1)(c) as an alternative \\nground of admissibility rather than as a hurdle to be surmounted in respect of otherwise admissible evidence. This \\nprocess of reasoning was disapproved in Walker [2007] EWCA Crim 1698, where it was held to be wrong to 'jump \\nstraight' to s. 121 without first locating a hearsay exception for each statement separately. See, however, Williams \\n(Ochaine) [2014] EWCA Crim 1862, in which the Court of Appeal seems also to jump to the s. 121 provisions, \\nalthough in that case it is arguable that no multiple hearsay was involved.\\nIn Musone [2007] EWCA Crim 1237, [2007] 1 WLR 2467, s. 121(1)(c) was invoked to admit the narration by a \\nreluctant witness of the victim's dying declaration. First-hand statements by the same witness were admitted under \\nHEARSAY EXCEPTIONS: (5) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE USE OF MULTIPLE HEARSAY\\ns. 114(1)(d) (see F17.34) and the Court of Appeal noted the similarity of the wording of the two 'interests of justice' \\nprovisions. The difference is that under s. 121(1)(c) the value of the evidence must be 'so high' that its admission is \\nrequired. In Thakrar [2010] EWCA Crim 1505, the Court approved of the use of s. 121 to admit statements taken in \\nNorthern Cyprus from witnesses who claimed to have heard D1 confess to three murders and related offences, and \\nto implicate his co-accused D2. The fact that the accounts contained details of the crimes that could only have been \\nknown to a participant was held to provide striking evidence of their reliability. By contrast, in Smith (Alec John) \\n[2020] EWCA Crim 777, [2020] 2 Cr App R 27 (436), the Court of Appeal was concerned with a confession of \\nsexual touching of V, an eight-year-old child, allegedly made some 50 years previously to D's wife and reported by \\nher to the mother of V, who told V. The mother had since died, and the wife denied that any confession had been \\nmade. The confession was presented as being bound up with the issue whether V had complained at the time, but \\nthese matters were severable, and the confession was likely to be influential with the jury. It was held that the \\nevidence 'could not possibly pass the test' in s. 121(1)(c).\\n\"]\n",

In C [2006] EWCA Crim 1079, [2006] 1 WLR 2994, the Court of \\nAppeal was keen to point out that the satisfaction of (in that case) s. 116 was only 'the first stage in a ruling upon \\nthe admissibility of the statement', and in Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373 the Court of Appeal (in a \\njudgment subsequently affirmed and described as 'complementary' to that of the Supreme Court) identified a range \\nof other measures designed to ensure fairness, including the duty to stop a case that, ultimately, proves to be \\nbased on unconvincing hearsay (under s. 125: see F17.98). The existence of s. 125 does not, however, lead to the \\nconclusion that hearsay should be admitted and a decision on it postponed to the end of the trial: in many cases a \\nruling will be required in advance of admitting the evidence.\\nThere is no corresponding mechanism for the exclusion of unfair defence evidence. See Bailey [2008] EWCA Crim \\n817, where counsel observed that a co-accused's ability to rely on the statement of a witness who has fled the \\ncountry amounts to a 'rogue's charter'. A narrower discretion does, however, exist in the CJA 2003, s. 126, under \\nwhich, according to some significant recent judicial comments, defence evidence may be excluded where it is \\nlacking in true probative value (see F17.94).\\nHearsay, Loss of Right to Cross-examine and Fair Trial Provisions\\nF17.89\\nFairness-based arguments for the exclusion of hearsay evidence emphasise the loss of the important right to cross-\\nexamine the absent witness, and the right of an accused person 'to examine or have examined witnesses against \\nhim' under the ECHR, Article 6(3)(d). In the leading case of Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373 the \\nSupreme Court dismissed a specific challenge to the CJA 2003 in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v UK (2009) 49 EHRR 1 \\n(1). In that case the ECtHR held that where a conviction is based 'solely or to a decisive degree' on statements \\nmade by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or have examined, the rights of the \\ndefence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with Article 6. The Supreme Court in Horncastle held that to \\nintroduce this qualification would involve rewriting the CJA 2003 to include a provision that Parliament had explicitly \\nrejected. The CJA 2003 sets out a rigorous scheme whereby the credibility and reliability of hearsay evidence can \\nbe tested (s. 124: see F17.87) and includes an overriding safeguard to stop a case based on unreliable evidence (s. \\n125: see F17.98). The safeguards were both more principled and more practical than the scheme suggested by the \\nECtHR in Al-Khawaja. Subsequently, the ruling of the Grand Chamber in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v UK (2012) 54 \\nEHRR 23 (807) substantially confirmed the view of the Supreme Court. It was conceded that the statutory \\nframework for admissibility of the evidence of absent witnesses is sufficient, properly applied, to provide for fair trial \\nin such cases. The court must, however, be satisfied that there is a good reason for the absence of the witness, as \\nwell as that a fair trial will still be possible despite the absence of the opportunity to cross-examine. The latter \\ncondition will be harder to satisfy if the evidence of the absent witness is the sole or decisive evidence against the \\naccused. The Grand Chamber drew attention in particular to the trial judge's power to stop a case based wholly or \\nHearsay, Loss of Right to Cross-examine and Fair Trial Provisions\\npartly on hearsay where a conviction would be unsafe. In Horncastle v UK (2015) 60 EHRR 31 (1331) the Grand \\nChamber reiterated these principles, emphasising that it was not necessary to show that decisive evidence is \\nreliable, or not unreliable to any significant extent, before it could fairly be admitted.\\nIn Ibrahim [2012] EWCA Crim 837, [2012] 4 All ER 225, the Court of Appeal noticed that there are differences in \\napproach between that decision and the decision of the Supreme Court in Horncastle. However, the core principle \\nto be deduced is that, where the untested hearsay evidence is 'critical', the question of whether the trial is fair \\ndepends on three principal factors: (1) good reason to admit the evidence (i.e. compliance with the CJA 2003); (2) \\nwhether the evidence can be shown to be reliable and (3) the extent to which counterbalancing measures exist and \\nhave been properly applied: this involves consideration of all the statutory safeguards in the CJA 2003, together \\nwith the application of common-law safeguards such as proper directions in the summing-up. In Riat [2012] EWCA \\nCrim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349 Hughes LJ noted that there seemed to be an element of misunderstanding around \\nthe proposition in Horncastle that 'sole or decisive' hearsay evidence might be admitted if it was 'demonstrably \\nreliable or its reliability was capable of proper testing and assessment'. There was clearly no rule that evidence had \\nto be independently verified before being put to a jury. Rather, a judge had to ensure that the evidence can safely \\nbe held to be reliable, given its strengths and weaknesses, the tools available to the jury for testing it and its \\nimportance to the case as a whole.\\nA detailed summary of the relevant principles derived from Horncastle, Ibrahim and Riat is given in Shabir [2012] \\nEWCA Crim 2564. In that case, the evidence of a witness who was in prison and suffering from paranoid \\nschizophrenia with persecutory and paranoid delusions should have been excluded, despite support for parts of his \\nevidence, as it could not be shown that his untested hearsay evidence on the central issue of the identity of D as \\nthe gunman was potentially safely reliable. See also Pedersen [2013] EWCA Crim 464, in which the statement of \\nthe complainant, who was suffering from a mental illness at the time when it was made and had died before the \\ntrial, was rightly excluded as to lack of consent in a count relating to rape because there was no evidence by which \\nthe conflict between her statement and D's account could properly be resolved. However, further statements by her \\nrelevant to the breaching by D of a restraining order were rightly admitted as there was other evidence by which the \\nreliability of her evidence could be assessed. In T (P) [2013] EWCA Crim 2398 it was held that the proposition in \\nHorncastle regarding the capacity of the jury to assess the reliability of hearsay evidence 'embraces with particular \\nforce the evidence of witnesses who had died or who could not be expected to have any present recollection of \\nevents described in witness statements made over 30 years previously'. However, none of the hearsay evidence in \\nissue in that case was of 'sole or decisive' importance to the success of the prosecution. In Barney [2014] EWCA \\nCrim 589, the decisive evidence of a deceased elderly victim identifying D as the perpetrator of a distraction \\nburglary was admitted. The witness's previous descriptions provided a method of testing her reliability, and D's \\nconvictions for similar offences provided further support.\\nThe leading authorities were also applied in Harvey [2014] EWCA Crim 54, in which the evidence of two witnesses \\nwho were absent through fear was central to the prosecution, but where there was strong evidence that supported \\nthe reliability of their accounts. This included the res gestae statement of the two witnesses themselves, made while \\nthey were still under the influence of the effect of an armed robbery (for res gestae, see F17.49) and the extent to \\nwhich the accounts subsequently given by the two tallied with one another, despite their lack of opportunity to \\nconfer immediately after the event. The Court of Appeal also drew attention to the availability for the defence of a \\nsignificant amount of evidence regarding the bad character of the two witnesses, who had links to the gangland \\nfraternity, that could be deployed in support of a possible alternative explanation for the presence of firearms in the \\nhome of one of them, which was also the location for the alleged armed robbery. Frequently cited in recent cases is \\nthe summary by Gross LJ in Friel [2012] EWCA Crim 2871:\\nIt is plain to us, therefore, that hearsay of any description is not to be nodded through or adduced as a matter \\nof routine. There is no inflexible rule against admissibility of central (or sole and decisive) hearsay evidence, \\nbut, on a spectrum, the more central the hearsay evidence is, the greater the care required. Sometimes \\nhearsay will be inadmissible or even if admissible the trial may need to be halted. But it is also necessary to \\nkeep in mind the public interest in securing the conviction of the guilty, as indeed it is always imperative to have \\nregard to the acquittal of the innocent and the avoidance of miscarriages of justice.Hearsay, Loss of Right to Cross-examine and Fair Trial Provisions\\nF17.90\\nIllustrations of the Courts' Approach The effect of the approach of the English courts is well illustrated by the \\nfacts of Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373. The victim of a serious beating gave a statement about how \\nhis injuries had been incurred, which was received following his death from an alcohol-related illness. Although the \\nstatement was critical evidence linking D to the attack, there was also substantial independent evidence of \\npresence at the scene, D had ample opportunity to challenge V's credibility, and the judge gave a full and clear \\ndirection about the disadvantages of challenging V on his memory and other relevant matters. By contrast, in \\nIbrahim [2012] EWCA Crim 837, [2012] 4 All ER 225, the evidence of V (the deceased victim of an alleged rape), \\nthough technically admissible, could not be shown to be reliable given V's heroin addiction, the fact that she had \\nmade an admittedly false formal statement to police on a similar matter (the reason for the withdrawal of that \\ncomplaint being also demonstrably false) and a long and unexplained delay in reporting the rape. The supporting \\nevidence, such as it was, did not overcome the doubts raised about V's reliability, and her evidence should either \\nhave been excluded under the PACE 1984, s. 78, or the trial stopped under the CJA 2003, s. 125 (see F17.98). \\nSee also Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349; Shabir [2012] EWCA Crim 2564 and Tahery [2013] \\nEWCA Crim 1053; in the last case, the Court of Appeal, on a reference from the CCRC in one of the cases that had \\nbeen the subject of the application to the Grand Chamber in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v UK (2012) 54 EHRR 23 \\n(807), held that the trial judge ought not to have admitted the unsupported evidence of a critical witness where the \\nobjective factors (his animosity and his previous inconsistency) pointed to unreliability. The bad character of an \\nabsent witness is not necessarily a reason for exclusion, even if it provides a basis for an inference of preparedness \\nto lie, provided that the evidence available to the jury is such that they can properly assess the risk of the witness \\nhaving done so (Adeojo [2013] EWCA Crim 41, where there was a wealth of other evidence linking the accused \\nwith the scene, but the absent witness provided the only direct evidence of identification). See also Jabbar [2013] \\nEWCA Crim 801.\\nThe fact that vulnerable witnesses are involved does not absolve domestic courts of their responsibility to ensure \\nthat there is no unfairness when allowing witness statements to be read. See PS v Germany (2003) 36 EHRR 61 \\n(1139) and SN v Sweden (2004) 39 EHRR 13 (304), where the use of special measures was sanctioned provided \\nthat the right of the defence to challenge the evidence was also safeguarded. In J [2011] EWCA Crim 3021, the \\nstatement of a three-year-old boy that he had been beaten by his mother's partner was held to have been rightly \\nadmitted under s. 114(1)(d) (see F17.38). An important feature of the decision was that the boy's injuries were non-\\naccidental and could only have been caused by D, the boy's mother or his grandmother. As both women gave \\nevidence that it was not them, it could not be said that the child's statement was the 'sole or decisive' evidence \\nagainst D. In AC [2014] EWCA Crim 371, the account of a child victim of rape was presented in hearsay form where \\nshe was too traumatised to testify. The tools to test the reliability of her description included the cross-examination \\nof her mother, who had supported her through the disclosure process, and there was supporting evidence of DNA \\nand indecent images of the child on AC's computer.\\nWhere the prosecutor has delayed proceedings and in consequence a witness is unavailable to testify, the court \\nmay exclude the witness's statement on the basis that the prosecution should have proceeded when the witness \\nwas available (French (1993) 97 Cr App R 421, and see Radak [1999] 1 Cr App R 187). Where an important \\nwitness for the prosecution deliberately goes missing during the trial, in circumstances giving rise to doubts about \\nthe reliability of the witness's account, it is unlikely that the evidence will be admitted as hearsay. In Kiziltan [2017] \\nEWCA Crim 1461, [2018] 4 WLR 43, the defence to kidnapping was that the complainant had colluded with Y to \\nfalsely incriminate the accused. After Y was cross-examined to this effect she spoke with the complainant, who, \\nhaving said he 'did not feel right' about giving evidence, did not attend to testify and could not be found. It was held \\nthat statements by the complainant identifying D ought to have been excluded, applying the PACE 1984, s. 78. In \\nSohal [2019] EWCA Crim 1237, an oversight resulted in two witnesses to a particular conversation involving D not \\nbeing warned to attend the trial. When the error was discovered, one witness was abroad at an unknown location, \\nand the other could not be found. It was held (at [47]) that their evidence, even if technically admissible under the \\nCJA 2003, s. 116(2), ought to have been excluded on grounds of fairness because 'in the circumstances of this \\ncase, the deficiencies of hearsay evidence, as opposed to the direct testimony of a witness who can be cross-\\nexamined, were particularly acute'. The relevant circumstances included the two witness statements being in Hearsay, Loss of Right to Cross-examine and Fair Trial Provisions\\nidentical terms, having clearly been taken by a professional investigator, and a number of important details being \\nunclear, including the language in which the conversation had been conducted (D having based his defence in part \\non his limited command of English). Where a statement is produced in this way for a witness to sign, the Court \\nnoted that there may often be a particular disadvantage for a defendant who is not able to cross- examine the \\nwitness.\\n\"]\n",

The Crown Court \\nCompendium, ch. 14, deals with the appropriate direction to be given in relation to all forms of hearsay, including \\nevidence admitted by agreement. The Compendium refers to the need for care in crafting directions and observes \\nthat the 'strength of the warning depends on the facts of the case and the significance of the hearsay evidence in \\nthe context of the case as whole'. In addition to a direction in the summing up, it is suggested that it is helpful to \\ngive a summary of the direction before hearsay is adduced. Drawing on the guidance given by the Privy Council in \\nGrant v The State [2005] UKPC 2, [2007] 1 AC 1 in relation to a statutory scheme similar to the CJA 2003, the \\nCompendium provides that the jury need to be directed on three major limitations of hearsay: (1) the lack of \\nopportunity to observe the demeanour of the person making the statement; (2) the fact that the statement was not \\nmade on oath and (3) the lack of opportunity to see the witness's statement tested under cross-examination. Where \\nthe credibility of the absent witness has been the subject of a challenge under s. 124 (see F17.87), the jury need to \\nbe reminded of the challenge and of any discrepancy or weakness revealed. The Compendium gives specific \\nguidance about particular forms of hearsay, given that the direction that is appropriate in respect of the evidence of \\nan absent witness is very different from what needs to be said in relation to the previous statement of a witness who \\ngives evidence in the proceedings, or in relation to a business document the accuracy of which is challenged. The \\ncontent of a direction may also vary according to whether the hearsay is relied upon by the prosecution or the \\ndefence, given the difference in the burden and standard of proof. In the case of hearsay tendered by the \\nprosecution, it may be appropriate to emphasise the need for caution. The object of the direction, whatever the \\nnature of the hearsay statement, is to assist the jury properly to assess the reliability and probative value of the \\nhearsay evidence and to ensure that material relevant to those questions, including any identifiable weaknesses, \\nshould be placed adequately and fairly before the jury. In many cases, particularly those involving absent \\nwitnesses, the considerations are similar to, and thus may be borrowed from, the factors listed in s. 114(2) in \\nrelation to admitting hearsay in the interests of justice (see F17.34). The judge should always discuss the terms of a \\ndirection with the advocates.\\nWhile failure to give appropriate directions in respect of prosecution evidence will not necessarily render a trial \\nunfair, it may do so, given the importance of the direction as a safeguard of the interests of the defence. In the \\nunusual case of Speed [2017] EWCA Crim 1908, the prosecution relied on the res gestae and ABE statements of \\nthe complainant of rape, who had gone abroad, but the jury were also presented with substantial evidence of her \\nlater attempts to resile from the allegations. The Court of Appeal, ordering a retrial, held that the judge should have \\ngiven a clear warning of the need for care before acting on the complaint (see also Maw [1994] Crim LR 841 and \\nF6.54).\\nIn Daley [2017] EWCA Crim 1971, the Court of Appeal reiterated the importance of giving a direction on the major \\nlimitations of hearsay evidence both before the evidence is given and in the summing-up. However, without \\nderogating from the importance of following this procedure in normal circumstances, the instant case was identified \\nas one in which the ground of the defence had shifted during the course of the trial away from discrediting the \\nhearsay evidence and towards establishing an alternative explanation for it. For that reason, the omission of the \\nhearsay directions was not a material misdirection such as to undermine the safety of the conviction.\\nJUDICIAL DIRECTIONS ON HEARSAY\\nF17.97\\nThe particular difficulty that arises in giving a warning where the evidence is tendered by the defence was \\nconsidered in Abiodun [2003] EWCA Crim 2167, where a 'mild' direction 'which simply reminded the jury of what in \\nany event would have been obvious to them, i.e. that the witnesses had not been cross-examined', was held not to \\nhave impinged on the fairness of the proceedings. In Williams (Ochaine) [2014] EWCA Crim 1862, the Court of \\nAppeal endorsed the view that the trial judge has a power to warn the jury about the dangers of hearsay evidence \\nfrom the defence. Fulford LJ said (at [96]):\\n… the judge, when giving directions to the jury on hearsay evidence relied on by the accused, must be \\nscrupulous to ensure that he does not shift the burden of proof away from the prosecution.

The Court of Appeal in Horncastle [2009] EWCA Crim 964, [2009] 2 Cr App \\nR 15 (230), in a judgment endorsed and regarded as complementary to the subsequent decision of the Supreme \\nCourt ([2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373), identified this (at [74]) as part of a set of safeguards forming a 'crafted \\ncode' on hearsay that protects the fair trial rights of the accused under the ECHR, Article 6:\\nPOWER TO STOP TRIAL WHERE CASE BASED ON HEARSAY\\n… at the close of all the evidence the judge is required, in a case where there is a legitimate argument that the \\nhearsay is unconvincing and important to the case, to make up his own mind, not as a fact-finder (which is the \\njury's function) but whether a conviction would be safe. That involves assessing the reliability of the hearsay \\nevidence, its place in the evidence as a whole, the issues in the case as they have emerged and all the other \\nindividual circumstances of the case. The importance of the evidence to the case is made a specific \\nconsideration by the statute: see s 125(1)(b).\\nIn Ibrahim [2012] EWCA Crim 837, [2012] 4 All ER 225, it was said that a judge should have uppermost in his or her \\nmind the question of whether an untested hearsay statement has been shown to be reliable in light of all the other \\nevidence adduced. If not, and the statement is 'part of the central corpus of evidence without which the case on the \\nrelevant count cannot proceed', the statement is 'almost bound to be “unconvincing” such that a conviction based \\non it will be unsafe'. In Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349, Hughes LJ stressed the difference \\nbetween cases subject to s. 125 and the general principles on submission of no case to answer contained in \\nGalbraith [1981] 2 All ER 1060 (see D16.54), where it is no part of the function of the judge to assess the reliability \\nof the evidence. In hearsay cases the judge is not only entitled but is required to see whether the hearsay evidence \\nis so unconvincing that any conviction would be unsafe. 'That means looking at its strengths and weaknesses, at \\nthe tools available to the jury for testing it, and at its importance to the case as a whole' (at [28]). Riat was applied in \\nRT [2020] EWCA Crim 1343, [2021] 1 Cr App R 14 (282). D was tried for serious sexual offences against his two \\nnephews, one of whom, TS, had committed suicide before the trial began. TS's recorded evidence was admitted \\nunder the CJA 2003, s. 116(2)(a) (see F17.8), and an application under the CJA 2003, s. 125, on the grounds that \\nthe evidence was so unconvincing that a conviction would be unsafe, was rejected. Section 125 required an \\nassessment of the relevant potentially reliable evidence as a whole. The trial judge had carefully considered \\nwhether an admittedly incorrect statement by TS in which he identified himself as the victim of an assault on a 'sex \\ntape' was necessarily a lie, or might have been attributable to honest mistake. He had also identified material \\ncapable of both testing and of supporting TS's account.\\n\"]\n",
