      "The concept of hearsay is deeply rooted in the history of criminal trials. As Lord Thomas CJ explained in Horncastle \n",
      "[2009] EWCA Crim 964, [2009] 2 Cr App R 15 (230), giving a judgment of the Court of Appeal regarded as \n",
      "supplementary to that of the Supreme Court in the same case ([2009] UKSC 14, [2010] 2 AC 373):\n",
      "… the law of England and Wales has … always insisted that it is ordinarily essential that evidence of the truth \n",
      "of a matter be given in person by a witness who speaks from his own observation or knowledge. It uses the \n",
      "legal expression 'hearsay' to describe evidence which is not so given, but rather is given second hand, whether \n",
      "related by a person to whom the absent witness has spoken, contained in a written statement of the absent \n",
      "witness, given in the form of a document or record created by him, or otherwise.\n",
      "Under the CJA 2003, s. 114(1), the definition of hearsay has to be gleaned from the proposition that 'a statement \n",
      "not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if, but only if'. Thus the \n",
      "essential ingredients are 'a statement' which is tendered 'as evidence of any matter stated'. 'Statement' is \n",
      "considered at F16.7 et seq., and 'matter stated' at F16.14 et seq.\n",
      "The essence of hearsay as an essentially second-hand account of relevant matters has not changed as a result of \n",
      "the CJA 2003, and neither has the rationale for regarding hearsay as generally inferior to first-hand evidence. The \n",
      "exact demarcation of evidence as hearsay or non-hearsay has shifted (in favour of admissibility) as a result of the \n",
      "statutory definition of a 'matter stated'. This results in a statement being non-hearsay in the absence of any purpose \n",
      "on the part of the maker to cause a person to believe the matter, or to cause a person or a machine to act as \n",
      "though it were as stated.\n",
      "Despite this minor modification, the hearsay rule is far-reaching, applying to both prosecution and defence. It covers \n",
      "not only the statements of non-witnesses, but also past statements made by a witness who is called to give oral \n",
      "evidence and who could therefore be cross-examined about what the witness has said previously (Horncastle). It \n",
      "applies to all statements, not simply to those made in anticipation of the trial itself, and includes documents as well \n",
      "as oral statements. It follows that the rule catches some evidence, such as records of routine business dealings, \n",

      "statement of a witness who has died before trial (and is thus the best evidence available) is able to be admitted \n",

      "said (at [21]):\n",
      "There were two principal reasons for excluding hearsay evidence. The first was that it was potentially \n",
      "unreliable. It might even be fabricated by the witness giving evidence of what he alleged he had been told by \n",
      "another. Quite apart from this, the weight to be given to such evidence was less easy to appraise than that of \n",
      "evidence delivered by a witness face to face with the defendant and subject to testing by cross-examination.\n",
      "The system of criminal justice in England and Wales depends critically on assessments of fact made by lay people, \n",
      "whether juries or magistrates, and as Lord Phillips also points out, the origins of the hearsay rule suggest a mistrust \n",
      "of their ability to cope with hearsay evidence. It follows that the wider availability of hearsay at trial under the CJA \n",
      "2003 means that the dangers posed by such evidence must more frequently be a factor to consider in the \n",
      "management of trials.\n",
      "As Hughes LJ said in Riat [2012] EWCA Crim 1509, [2013] 1 All ER 349:\n",
      "[Hearsay] is necessarily second-hand and for that reason very often second-best. Because it is second-hand, it \n",
      "is that much more difficult to test and assess. The jury frequently never sees the person whose word is being \n",
      "relied upon. Even if there is a video recording of the witness' interview, that person cannot be asked a single \n",
      "exploratory or challenging question about what is said. From the point of view of a defendant, the loss of the \n",
      "ability to confront one's accusers is an important disadvantage. Those very real risks of hearsay evidence, \n",
      "which underlay the common law rule generally excluding it, remain critical to its management. Sometimes it is \n",
      "necessary in the interests of justice for it to be admitted. It may not suffer from the risks of unreliability which \n",
      "often attend such evidence, or its reliability can realistically be assessed. Equally, however, sometimes it is \n",
      "necessary in the interests of justice either that it should not be admitted at all, or that a trial depending upon it \n",
      "should not be allowed to proceed to the jury because any conviction would not be safe.\n",
      "For these reasons, hearsay that is technically admissible under the CJA 2003 is subject to a battery of further \n",
      "safeguards aimed at minimising the dangers identified above. These include the giving of notice of intention to use \n",
      "hearsay evidence (see F17.5), the provision of special rules to scrutinise the credibility of the maker of the \n",
      "statement (s. 124: see F17.87) and the giving of appropriate judicial directions about hearsay (see F17.96). Where \n",

      "prosecution, or under the CJA 2003, s. 126, in the case of prosecution or defence: see F17.88 et seq.), and a trial \n",
      "which is dependent on hearsay may in some cases be stopped (see F17.98). The wider significance of these \n",
      "safeguards lies in protecting the fair trial rights of the defendant (see F17.5). It follows that the process of deciding \n",
      "whether evidence is hearsay is as important as it ever was, as the safeguards to be applied are of a quite different \n",
      "order from those applicable to non-hearsay statements.\n",

      "Dangers of Hearsay Evidence\n",

      "extreme case where a third party has confessed to the offence with which the accused is charged, the confession, \n",
      "being hearsay, is inadmissible unless an exception can be found (Turner (1975) 61 Cr App R 67; Blastland [1986] \n",
