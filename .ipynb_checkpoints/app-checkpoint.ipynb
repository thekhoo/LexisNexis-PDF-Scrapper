These sections must \\nbe read in conjunction with sch. 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978.\\nInterpretation Act 1978, sch. 1\\n(a)     'indictable offence' means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable on indictment, whether it is \\nexclusively so triable or triable either way;\\n(b)     'summary offence' means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable only summarily;\\n(c)     'offence triable either way' means an offence, other than an offence triable on indictment only by virtue of [s. \\n40] of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 which, if committed by an adult, is triable either on indictment or summarily;\\n and the terms 'indictable', 'summary' and 'triable either way', in their application to offences, are to be \\nconstrued accordingly.\\nThe Interpretation Act 1978 qualifies the above definitions with the rider that 'references ... to the way or ways in \\nwhich an offence is triable are to be construed without regard to the effect, if any, of section 22 of the Magistrates' \\nCourts Act 1980 on the mode of trial in a particular case'. The broad effect of s. 22 of the MCA 1980 is that the \\noffences under s. 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 involving damage not exceeding the relevant sum (currently \\n£5,000) must be dealt with as if they were triable only summarily (see D6.20).\\n\"}, 'D6.3': {'section_heading': 'CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES', 'section_subheading': 'Definition of the Classes of Offences', 'section_text': \"Where an Act contains the phrase 'indictable offence' without any further qualification, it must be understood to \\nmean both those offences which, in the case of an adult, must be tried on indictment and those which (again in the \\ncase of an adult) carry the right to trial on indictment although they can be tried summarily with the agreement of the \\naccused and of the magistrates. Summary offences, on the other hand, are entirely distinct from indictable offences \\nand must always be tried summarily, unless s. 40 of the CJA 1988 applies. The reason for the Interpretation Act \\n1978 definitions referring each time to the possible mode of trial in the case of an adult is that special rules apply to \\nthe trial of children and young people, greatly restricting the use of trial on indictment (see s. 24 of the MCA 1980 \\nand D24).\\nThe CJA 1988, s. 40, enables certain specified summary offences to appear on an indictment if they are linked to \\nan indictable offence for which the accused has been sent to the Crown Court for trial (see D11.17). Those offences \\ninclude common assault; taking a motor vehicle without consent; driving whilst disqualified; and criminal damage \\nwhere the value of the damage does not exceed £5,000 (and so the provisions of the MCA 1980, s. 22, apply: see \\nD6.20). Moreover, under the CLA 1967, s. 6(3A), a jury can (by way of alternative verdict under s. 6(3)) convict an \\naccused of a summary offence to which the CJA 1988, s. 40, applies, even if a count charging the offence is not \\nincluded in the indictment (see D19.42).\\n\"}, 'D6.4': {'section_heading': 'CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES', 'section_subheading': 'Determining the Class of an Offence', 'section_text': 'An offence is triable either way if either : (a) it is listed in the MCA 1980, sch. 1 (see D6.5) (the MCA 1980, s. 17, \\nprovides that, without prejudice to any other enactment by virtue of which an offence is triable either way, the \\noffences listed in sch. 1 shall be so triable); or (b) the enactment creating the offence (where the offence is a \\nstatutory one) specifies one penalty on summary conviction and a different (invariably greater) penalty on conviction \\non indictment.

The magistrates are not obliged to give such an indication (s. 20(4)). If the court does give an \\nindication of sentence, it must ask the accused whether he or she wishes, on the basis of the indication, to \\nreconsider the indication of plea which was given (s. 20(5)). If the accused does wish to do so, the court \\nmust ask for a fresh indication of intended plea, and so the 'plea before venue' stage is repeated (s. 20(6)).\\n (e)     If the accused indicates an intention to plead guilty following an indication of sentence, this is regarded \\nas a guilty plea (s. 20(7)), and the magistrates' court will proceed to sentence, if necessary adjourning for a \\npre-sentence report; in such a case, a custodial sentence will be available only if such a sentence was \\nindicated by the court (s. 20A(1)).

At the Crown Court, the prosecution did not proceed with \\nthe either-way offence or the other summary offence. The only charge before the Crown Court, therefore, was the \\nshoplifting. The court ruled that the indictment was a nullity because, unless the accused elects Crown Court trial, \\nlow-value shoplifting is not capable of forming the sole count of an indictment (at [27]); only the magistrates' court \\nhad power to deal with the offence of low-value shoplifting unless the accused elected Crown Court trial (at [31]).\\nWhere the accused is 'charged on the same occasion' with two or more offences of low-value shoplifting, the value \\nof the offences is aggregated, and s. 22A applies only if the total value does not exceed £200 (s. 22A(4)(b)). The \\nphrase, 'charged on the same occasion', is to be construed in the same way as it is for the purposes of the special \\ncriminal damage provisions (see D6.25) (Harvey [2020] EWCA Crim 354, [2020] 2 Cr App R 10 (152), at [20]).\\nIn Maxwell [2017] EWCA Crim 1233, [2018] 1 Cr App R 5 (76), the Court of Appeal ruled that low-value shoplifting \\ncharges cannot be aggregated with shoplifting offences to which s. 22A does not apply (and so it is only the 'low-\\nvalue' offences that can be aggregated). In this case, the three low-value offences came nowhere near £200 in total \\nand so were (unless the accused elected Crown Court trial) triable only summarily. The Court also rejected the \\nsuggestion that the CDA 1998, s. 40 (see D11.17), applies to low-value shoplifting. The Secretary of State has \\npower (under s. 40(4)) to specify additional offences by statutory instrument; however, low-value shoplifting has not \\nbeen so specified.\\nSimilarly, in Burrows [2019] EWCA Crim 889, D was sent for trial for going equipped for stealing (TA 1968, s. 25), \\nhaving elected Crown Court trial for that offence.

The Court of Appeal noted (at [9]) that only summary offences that are listed in the CJA 1988, s. 40, can be \\njoined to an indictment. Low-value shoplifting is not one of the offences listed in s. 40 and so, 'in the absence of an \\nelection by the accused it cannot be included as a count on the indictment'.

The Divisional Court held (at [45]) that, as in the Crown Court, an accused in a magistrates' court must \\nenter a guilty plea personally. The requirements of s. 17A are to be treated as going to the jurisdiction of the court. It \\nfollows that, if a guilty plea is not entered by the accused personally, that plea (and any proceedings subsequent to \\nthat plea, such as committal for sentence) is to be regarded as a nullity.\\n\"}, 'D6.30': {'section_heading': 'VARIATION OF ORIGINAL DECISION AS TO ALLOCATION', 'section_subheading': 'Introduction', 'section_text': \"Variation of the allocation decision is governed by the MCA 1980, s. 25 (see D6.31), which enables the prosecution \\nto make an application to the magistrates (before the start of the summary trial) to reconsider their acceptance of \\nsummary jurisdiction.\\nBy virtue of s. 25(2), where the accused has consented to summary trial (the magistrates having first accepted \\njurisdiction), the prosecution may apply to the court for the offence to be tried on indictment instead (s. 25(2)).

The following propositions emerge from his judgment:\\n (a)     The magistrates have a discretion to permit the accused to withdraw consent to summary trial, \\nnotwithstanding that the provisions now contained in the MCA 1980, s. 20(9)(a), state that, if an accused \\nconsents to be tried summarily, the court shall proceed to summary trial. It would seem that the accused \\ncould, in theory, be allowed to reconsider consent to summary trial even after the trial on a not guilty plea \\nhas begun. However, it is submitted that, once a significant portion of the prosecution evidence has been \\ngiven, a change of election should be allowed only in very exceptional circumstances, since otherwise the \\ndefence might be tempted to ask to withdraw consent to summary trial as a tactical ploy simply because \\nthe trial seems to be going badly.\\n (b)     In exercising their discretion whether to accede to an application to withdraw consent, magistrates must \\nhave regard to the 'broad justice' of the situation (per Lord Widgery CJ in Southampton Justices, ex parte \\nBriggs [1972] 1 All ER 573 at p. 280). They are entitled to take into account: (i) that the accused had the \\nright to elect Crown Court trial fully explained; (ii) that the accused understood those rights; (iii) that the \\naccused voluntarily consented to be tried summarily; and (iv) that there were no unusual, difficult or grave \\nfeatures in the case (Lambeth Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Wright [1974] Crim LR 444, as \\nexplained by McCullough J in Ex parte Hodgson [1985] QB 1131 at p. 1140A-C).\\n (c)     Consent to summary trial given when unrepresented and intending to plead guilty through a \\nmisunderstanding of the law is invalid because, even if the accused understands the nature of the choice in \\nthe sense of knowing the difference between trial on indictment and summary trial, the accused does not \\ntruly appreciate the significance of the choice (Ex parte Hodgson, see especially p. 1146D-H).\\n (d)     It is implicit in the judgment of McCullough J that the fact that the accused was unrepresented when \\nconsenting to summary trial is not sufficient by itself to compel the court to allow a withdrawal of consent, \\neven if the accused is subsequently advised that trial on indictment would be preferable. Conversely, \\nalthough having had legal advice before consenting would obviously be a very powerful argument against \\nan application to withdraw consent, there is no reason to suppose that it must inevitably be decisive.\\n (e)     Most important, where the material before the magistrates shows that the accused, when consenting to \\nsummary trial, did not properly understand the 'nature and significance' of the choice, the broad justice of \\nthe situation demands that the accused be allowed to withdraw consent (Exparte Hodgson [1985] QB 1131 \\nat pp. 1144-5).\\n (f)     Where it is said that the accused did not understand the nature and significance of the choice, the court's \\nview that the case is, in fact, more suitable for summary trial is not a factor which should tell against an \\napplication to withdraw consent (per McCullough J in Ex parte Hodgson [1985] QB 1131 atp. 1145A-B and \\nEx parte Weekes [1985] QB 1147 at p. 1152C-E).\\n\"}, 'D6.33': {'section_heading': 'WITHDRAWAL BY ACCUSED OF ORIGINAL CONSENT', 'section_subheading': 'General', 'section_text': \"Where the accused is arguing a lack of understanding of the consequences of the original consent to summary trial, \\nit is for the accused to establish that fact, whether by giving evidence or by other means. Moreover, if the justices \\nhearing the application are different from those who originally sat, they must receive evidence as to what occurred \\nat the earlier hearing (Forest Magistrates' Court, ex parte Spicer (1989) 153 JP 81). The accused's consent to \\nsummary trial is likely, in practice, to be closely connected to the plea. If, having consented to summary trial, the \\naccused pleads guilty but is then allowed to change the plea to not guilty, permission should be given to withdraw \\nconsent to summary trial, so that the allocation procedure can be repeated (Bow Street Magistrates' Court, ex parte \\nWelcombe (1992) 156 JP 609).\\n\"}, 'D6.34': {'section_heading': 'WITHDRAWAL BY ACCUSED OF ORIGINAL CONSENT', 'section_subheading': 'Challenging Refusal of Magistrates to Allow Withdrawal of Consent', 'section_text': 'If an application by the accused to withdraw consent to summary trial is refused, the refusal may be challenged by \\nmeans of an application for judicial review (see D29.25 et seq) It will, however, be necessary to show either that the \\nmagistrates took into account irrelevant factors or ignored relevant ones when deciding to hold the accused to the \\noriginal decision, or that they acted so unreasonably that no bench properly directing itself could have reached their \\ndecision. In Highbury Corner Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Weekes [1985] QB 1147, for example, \\nD, who was aged 17, had not had the opportunity to consult a lawyer and did not properly understand what a Crown \\nCourt was.

Where the prosecution choose to \\nreplace an offence which is triable either way with an offence which is triable only summarily, the accused is \\nthereby deprived of the possibility of trial by jury. In Canterbury and St Augustine Justices, ex parte Klisiak [1982] \\nQB 398, it was held that the court can prevent the prosecution from doing this only 'in the most obvious \\ncircumstances which disclose blatant injustice' (per Lord Lane CJ at p. 411F). In Sheffield Justices, ex parte DPP \\n[1993] Crim LR 136, the Divisional Court said that it would be appropriate to interfere with the prosecutor's decision \\nto replace an either-way charge with a summary-only charge only if there was evidence that the prosecutor had \\ndone so in order to manipulate the system (in other words, acting in bad faith). However, in DPP v Hammerton \\n[2009] EWHC 921 (Admin), [2010] QB 79, where D was charged with attempted theft (triable either way) but the \\nprosecution subsequently sought to replace the charge with one of interfering with a motor vehicle (a summary \\noffence), Davis J pointed out that the courts now have to take into account the CrimPR, and in particular the \\noverriding objective and said (at [24] and [30]) that:\\n... the language of 'proper and appropriate' better conveys the correct approach in cases of this kind ... I doubt \\nif it now needs be shown that bad faith as such needs be shown in all cases before an application to substitute \\na new charge can be disallowed ...\\n... in the vast majority of cases everyone concerned will be entirely content for a lesser charge to be \\nsubstituted. But where a lesser charge is to be substituted, first, it must be proper and appropriate to the facts \\nof the case; secondly, the application should be made promptly and not left until the last minute, at all events \\nwithout any proper explanation; and, thirdly, an eye should also be kept on considerations of the good \\nadministration of justice and the wider picture.\\nFor example, the impact on any co-accused might be relevant.\\n\"}, 'D6.36': {'section_heading': 'ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES TO DICTATE ALLOCATION', 'section_subheading': 'Challenging Refusal of Magistrates to Allow Withdrawal of Consent', 'section_text': \"It is also possible for a charge which is triable either way to be replaced with a charge that is triable only on \\nindictment. However, in Brooks [1985] Crim LR 385, the Court of Appeal warned that it would be unjust and wrong \\nfor the prosecution to do this if the magistrates have already accepted jurisdiction in respect of the either-way \\noffence, since the prosecution would be frustrating the decision reached by the justices. The principles were \\nsummarised by Neill LJ in Redbridge Justices, ex parte Whitehouse [1992] 94 Cr App R 332 (at p. 338):\\n(3) …If the prosecution … seek to prefer new charges or to substitute charges or to offer no evidence on \\ncertain charges the justices should consider the matter on its merits. The fact that the prosecution wish to add \\nor substitute new charges either to ensure that the case is tried summarily or to ensure that it is tried in the \\nCrown Court is not a ground for refusing the issue of a summons or other process provided that on the facts \\ndisclosed the justices are satisfied that the course proposed by the prosecution is proper and appropriate in the \\nlight of the facts put before them. Thus clearly the justices should not agree to the addition of a charge which is \\ntriable only on indictment if the facts are incapable of supporting such a charge and the fresh charge can be \\nseen to be a device designed to deprive the justices of their jurisdiction to try the case themselves. (4) If the \\njustices have already decided to try a matter summarily and the case is then adjourned, any later application by \\nADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES TO DICTATE ALLOCATION\\nthe prosecution to add an additional charge which would have the effect of making summary trial no longer \\npossible should be scrutinised with particular care. The prosecution cannot be allowed improperly to frustrate \\nthe earlier decision of the justices. However, I do not understand the decision in Brooks ... as meaning that \\nonce the justices have decided on summary trial there are no circumstances in which the prosecutor can \\nproperly seek to add a further charge which is triable only on indictment ... (5) If the justices acting within their \\njurisdiction exercise their discretion bona fide and bring their minds to bear on the question whether they ought \\nto grant a further summons or not, this Court is very unlikely to interfere except in an exceptional case where \\nthe decision satisfies the strict test of being unreasonable in a Wednesbury sense.\\nIt must also be borne in mind that the Code for Crown Prosecutors, para. 6.4 (see Supplement, Code for Crown \\nProsecutors), states that: 'Prosecutors should not change the charge simply because of the decision made by the \\ncourt or the defendant about where the case will be heard'.\\n\"}, 'D6.37': {'section_heading': \"CHALLENGING A DECISION BY A MAGISTRATES' COURT TO ACCEPT JURISDICTION\", 'section_subheading': 'Challenging Refusal of Magistrates to Allow Withdrawal of Consent', 'section_text': \"It is difficult for the prosecution to mount a challenge against a decision in favour of summary trial, since it is \\nessentially a matter within the magistrates' discretion. An application to quash a decision to accept jurisdiction will \\nsucceed only if the magistrates' decision was so obviously wrong that no reasonable magistrate could have arrived \\nat it (McLean, ex parte Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1975] Crim LR 289). Nevertheless, in an appropriately \\nclear-cut case, the Divisional Court will grant judicial review. In Northampton Magistrates' Court, ex parte \\nCommissioners of Customs and Excise [1994] Crim LR 598, for example, D was charged with a VAT fraud which, \\non the prosecution case, had caused a loss of £193,000. The magistrates decided to try him summarily and the \\nprosecution sought judicial review. The Divisional Court said that the correct approach was to ask whether the \\nacceptance of jurisdiction was 'truly astonishing'.

However, the CJA 1988, s. 40, provides that where \\ncertain specified summary offences (including common assault, driving while disqualified, taking a motor vehicle \\nwithout the owner's consent, and criminal damage where the value involved does not exceed £5,000) are disclosed \\nby the evidence on the basis of which an accused has been sent for trial in respect of an indictable offence, and the \\nsummary offence is either founded on the same facts as the indictable offence or forms with it a series of offences \\nof the same or similar character, then the prosecution may include a count for the summary offence on the \\nindictment and, if the accused pleads not guilty, the charge will be tried by a jury (see D11.17).\\nThe CDA 1998, s. 51(6), provides that, where the court sends an accused for trial in respect of an indictable-only or \\neither-way offence, it must also send the accused to the Crown Court for trial for any summary offence which \\nappears to the court to be related to the offence(s) which are sent for trial, provided that the summary offence is \\npunishable with imprisonment or involves disqualification from driving. Unless the summary offence is one to which \\nthe CJA 1988, s. 40, applies and is added to the indictment, sch. 3, para. 6, governs the procedure in respect of the \\nsummary offence (see D10.29). If the accused is convicted on the indictment, the Crown Court must, assuming it \\nagrees that the summary offence is related to the offence(s) sent for trial under s. 51, ask the accused to enter a \\nplea to the summary offence. If a guilty plea is entered, the Crown Court may deal with the offender in respect of \\nthat offence in any way in which a magistrates' court could have done; if a not guilty plea is entered, the powers of \\nthe Crown Court cease in respect of the summary offence (save that the court may dismiss the charge if the \\nprosecution inform the court that they would not desire to submit evidence in respect of it). It is submitted that (even \\nthough para. 6 is silent as to the possibility) it would also be open to a Crown Court judge to try the summary \\noffence, sitting as a district judge (magistrates' courts) under the Courts Act 2003, s. 66 (see D3.16).\\n\"}}\n"
