# PDF Data Scrapper for Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 (Part D - Procedure)

# WIP

## Introduction

**NOTE:** This tool was designed purely for Part D of the Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 Document from Lexis Library. The tool seems to work fine on Parts D, E, F and R from Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 from Lexis Library.

## How to use the tool



## File Naming Conventions

### Downloaded PDFs

Name the PDF file based on the Part and Section that it belongs to. For example:

*Part D5 - Starting a Prosecution and Preliminary Proceedings in Magistrates' Court should be named as **D5.pdf**.*

The file should be saved in a folder called `data`.

## Future Work

1. Handle key errors if a subsection outside the range of the pdf is requested.
2. Different log category classifications.
