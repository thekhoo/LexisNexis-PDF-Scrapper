# PDF Data Scrapper for Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 (Part D - Procedure)

## Introduction

This is a mini project and my first attempt at writing a program and pushing it to Github. Aside from helping my friend with a quicker way to copy from the law document, I used this as an opportunity to practice version control and sharpen my understanding of regex and pattern recognition.

This program is designed to get all the sections and subsections from Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 Documents based on the input in `topics.json`. All the text will then be formatted appropriately and exported in a word document (.docx) per the structure described in `topics.json`.

TL;DR - A tool to extract subsections as required from Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 from Lexis Library into a word document.

**NOTE:** This program was designed purely for Part D of the Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 Document from Lexis Library. 

**Update 06/10/22:** The program seems to work fine on Parts D, E, F and R from Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022 from Lexis Library.

## How to use the tool

1. Download all the files into a folder and create a folder called `data` and `output`.

    * The `data` folder will be used to store all the PDF files downloaded from Lexis Library Blackstone's Criminal Practice 2022.

    * The `output` folder will be where all the word files are written to.

2. Install the packages required from `requirements.txt`.

3. Create a JSON file called `topics.json` in the same directory as the `blackstone_scrapper.py` file. This will be used to tell the program which sections and subsections to scrape. The structure of the file is as follows:

    ```js
    // All text with square brackets [] are variables and can be named according to preference.
    // All other text are constants that are used as keys throughout the program.

    {
        "doc_title": "",    // This is the title of the .docx file that will be created.

        "doc_data": {       // This is the data that the program should look for.

            "[topic_number]" : {        // This is the start of a topic. There can be as many topics as you want within this JSON file.

                "title": "",            // The title of this topic.
                "sections": {           // The sections and subsections that the progrma should look for

                    // The keys here are actually variables but I've displayed them as text as an example situation.

                    "D5": [1,2,3,4,5],           // Use a list for the subsections within that particular section 
                    "D9": [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]        // Example: D5.1 - D5.5 and D9.2 - D9.8
                    .
                    .
                    .
                }
            }
            .
            .
            .
        }
    }
    ```

4. Run the file `blackstone_scrapper.py`.

5. The generated word document (.docx) will be exported in the `output` folder ready to be used.

## File Naming Conventions

### Downloaded PDFs

Name the PDF file based on the Part and Section that it belongs to. For example:

*Part D5 - Starting a Prosecution and Preliminary Proceedings in Magistrates' Court should be named as **D5.pdf**.*

The file should be saved in a folder called `data`.

## Future Work

1. Handle key errors if a subsection outside the range of the pdf is requested.
2. Different log category classifications.
3. Introduce appropriate error codes to identify errors.
4. Update all hardcoded filepaths with `os.path.join()` for cross OS functionality.
